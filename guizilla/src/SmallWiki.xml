{{Unreferenced|date=May 2010}}'''Macro-historical''' analysis seeks out large, long-term trends in world history, searching for ultimate patterns through a comparison of proximate details. For example, a macro-historical study might examine Japanese feudalism and European [[feudalism]] in order to decide whether feudal structures are an inevitable outcome given certain conditions. Macro-historical studies often &quot;assume that macro-historical processes repeat themselves in explainable and understandable ways&quot;.[http://parallelism.org/13949-WELL-layout2.pdf]

==History==
Examples of macro-historical analysis include [[Karl Marx]]'s assertion that all history can be explained through [[economics]] and [[class struggle]], and [[Arnold J. Toynbee]]'s historical synthesis in explaining the rise and fall of civilizations. [[Battle of Ain Jalut]] which is considered by many historians to be of great macro-historical importance, as it marked the highwater point of Mongol conquests, and the first time they had ever been decisively defeated.

Another example is the [[Battle of Bannockburn]], (June 23?24, 1314), decisive battle in Scottish history, whereby the Scots under Robert the Bruce defeated the English under Edward II, regained their independence, and established Bruce on his throne as Robert I. The Scottish victory was complete and, although full English recognition of Scottish independence was not achieved until more than ten years later, Robert Bruce's position as king was greatly strengthened by the outcome.

Anatopism
</title>

<text>
An '''anatopism''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''???'', &quot;against,&quot; and ''?????'', &quot;place&quot;) is something that is out of its proper place.  Thus, for example, an [[outrigger canoe]] would be an anatopism in [[ancient Rome]].The [[concept]] of anatopism is less widely familiar than that of [[anachronism]], perhaps because much that is anatopistic is also anachronistic.  Yet the distinction is a valid one; not all that is anatopistic is necessarily also anachronistic.

==Examples==
[[Catherine Hardwicke]]'s 2006 film, ''[[The Nativity Story]]'', shows a field of [[maize]] corn in a [[Nazareth]] farming scene.  Maize is native to [[Mesoamerica]], not to the [[Middle East]], and in [[pre-Columbian]] times was grown only in the [[Americas]].  The use of maize in this film is clearly an anatopism.

The [[Poland|Polish]] writer [[Boles?aw Prus]], for the sake of making a point, introduces into chapter 63 of his [[historical novel]] ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'', set in the [[ancient Egypt]] of 1087?1085 BCE, a substance that behaves like [[gunpowder]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Boles?aw Prus]], ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'', pp. 579-81.&lt;/ref&gt;  This appears to be both an anachronism and an anatopism, since gunpowder is thought to have been invented, some time later, in [[China]] or in [[Arab world|Arabia]].  Another apparent anatopism introduced by the author (in chapter 45) is an object that resembles a [[telescope]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Boles?aw Prus]], ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'', p. 391.&lt;/ref&gt; that may also be an [[anachronism]].

Historicity (philosophy)
</title>

<text>
'''Historicity''' in [[philosophy]] is the underlying concept of [[history]], or the intersection of [[teleology]] (the concept and study of progress and purpose), [[temporality]] (the concept of time), and [[historiography]] ([[semiotics]] and history of [[history]]). Varying conceptualizations of historicity emphasize linear progress or the repetition or modulation of past events.== Concepts of historicity ==
In [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], historicity is the history of constitution of any [[intentionality|intentional]] object, both in the sense of history as [[tradition]] and in the sense where every individual has its own history. Of course, these two senses are often very similar: One individual's history is heavily influenced by the tradition the individual is formed in, but personal history can also produce an object that wouldn't be a part of any tradition. In addition, personal historicity doesn't develop in the same way as tradition.

[[Martin Heidegger]] argued in ''[[Being and Time]]'' that it is temporality that gives rise to history.  All things have their place and time, and nothing past is outside of history.

[[Francis Fukuyama]] in ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]'' famously argued that the collapse of [[Soviet communism]] brought humanity to the &quot;end of history&quot; whereby the world's global dialectical machinations had been resolved with the triumph of liberal capitalism.

Before Fukuyama, [[Jean Baudrillard]] argued for a different concept of the &quot;end of history&quot;. Baudrillard's most in-depth writings on the notion of historicity are found in the books ''Fatal Strategies'' and ''The Illusion of the End''. It is for these writings that he received a full-chapter denunciation from the physicist [[Alan Sokal]] (along with [[Jean Bricmont]]), due to his alleged misuse of physical concepts of linear time, space and stability. In contrast to Fukuyama's argument, Baudrillard maintained that the &quot;end of history&quot;, in terms of a [[teleology|teleological]] goal, had always been an illusion brought about by modernity's will towards progress, civilization and rational unification. And this was an illusion that to all intents and purposes vanished toward the end of the 20th century, brought about by the &quot;speed&quot; at which society moved, effectively 'destabilising' the linear progression of history (it is these comments, specifically, that provoked Sokal's criticism). History was, so to speak, outpaced by its own spectacular realisation. As Baudrillard himself caustically put it:

:''The end of history is, alas, also the end of the dustbins of history. There are no longer any dustbins for disposing of old ideologies, old regimes, old values. Where are we going to throw Marxism, which actually invented the dustbins of history? (Yet there is some justice here since the very people who invented them have fallen in.) Conclusion: if there are no more dustbins of history,'' this is because History itself has become a dustbin. ''It has become its own dustbin, just as the planet itself is becoming its own dustbin.''&lt;ref&gt;''The Illusion of the End'', or ''Selected Writings'', p. 263&lt;/ref&gt;

This approach to history is what marks out Baudrillard's affinities with the [[postmodernism|postmodern]] philosophy of [[Jean-Fran?ois Lyotard]]: the idea that society ? and Western society in particular ? has 'dropped out' of the grand narratives of history (for example the coming of Communism or the triumph of civilized modern society). But Baudrillard has supplemented this argument by contending that, although this 'dropping out' may have taken place, the global world (which in Baudrillard's writing is sharply distinct from a [[universal humanity]]) is, in accordance with its spectacular understanding of itself, condemned to 'play out' this illusory ending in a hyper-teleological way ? acting out the end of the end of the end, ''ad infinitum''. Thus Baudrillard argues that ? in a manner similar to [[Giorgio Agamben]]'s book ''Means without Ends'' ? Western society is subject to the political restriction of means that are justified by ends that do not exist.

[[Michel-Rolph Trouillot]] offers a different insight into the meaning and uses of Historicity. Trouillot explains that &quot;The ways in which what happened,and what is said to have happened are and are not the same may itself be historical&quot;.

{{For|[[Isaac Asimov]]'s use of the term in science fiction|psychohistory (fictional)}}'''Psychohistory''' is the study of the psychological motivations of historical events.&lt;ref&gt;http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119612862/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0&lt;/ref&gt; It attempts to combine the insights of [[psychotherapy]] with the research methodology of the [[social sciences]] to understand the emotional origin of the social and [[political]] behavior of groups and nations, past and present. Its subject matter is childhood and the [[family]] (especially [[child abuse]]), and psychological studies of [[anthropology]] and [[ethnology]].
==Description==
[[Image:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 035.jpg|thumb|right|Rembrandt's painting of the sacrifice of Isaac, from the Old Testament.]]

Psychohistory derives many of its concepts from areas that are perceived to be ignored by conventional historians as shaping factors of human history, in particular, the effects of [[childbirth]], [[parenting]] practice, and child abuse.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

The historical impact of [[incest]], [[infanticide]] and [[child sacrifice]] are considered. Psychohistory holds that human societies can change between infanticidal and non-infanticidal practices and has coined the term &quot;[[early infanticidal childrearing]]&quot; to describe abuse and neglect observed by many anthropologists. [[Lloyd deMause]], the pioneer of psychohistory, has described a system of psychogenic modes (see below) which describe the range of styles of parenting he has observed historically and across cultures.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}
Many anthropologists concur that &quot;the science of culture is independent of the laws of [[biology]] and [[psychology]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Psychohistory relies heavily on historical biography. Notable examples of [[psychobiography|psychobiographies]] are those of [[Lewis Bernstein Namier|Lewis Namier]], who wrote about the [[British House of Commons]], and [[Fawn Brodie]], who wrote about [[Thomas Jefferson]].

Science fiction author and scientist/science writer [[Isaac Asimov]] popularized the term in his famous [[Foundation series]] of novels, though in his works the term is used fictionally for a mathematical discipline that can be used to predict the general course of future history.

===Areas of psychohistorical study===
There are three inter-related areas of psychohistorical study.&lt;ref name=&quot;Primalpages&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://primal-page.com/psyhis.htm |title=Lloyd deMause and Psychohistory |accessdate=2008-03-11 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=Primal Psychotherapy WebPages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''' 1.- The History of Childhood''' - which looks at such questions as:
*How have children been raised throughout history
*How has the family been constituted
*How and why have practices changed over time
*The changing place and value of children in society over time
*How and why our views of child abuse and neglect have changed

'''2.- [[Psychobiography]]''' - which  seeks to understand individual historical people and their motivations in history.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

'''3.- Group Psychohistory''' - which  seeks to understand the motivations of large groups, including nations, in history and current affairs.  In doing so, psychohistory advances the use of group-fantasy analysis of political speeches, political cartoons and media headlines since the fantasy words therein offer clues to unconscious thinking and behaviors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Primalpages&quot;/&gt;

===Emergence as a discipline===
[[Sigmund Freud]]'s well known work, ''[[Civilization and Its Discontents]]'' (1929), included an analysis of history based on his theory of psychoanalysis. Yet, Freud's text is in no way a psycho-historical work since the focus of the study is to move beyond the level of individual psyche to explain the influence of the structures of civilization. Rather, Freud's work is the opposite of psycho-history that claims that the unconscious and the individual psyche are both structural effects of different social forces.

[[Wilhelm Reich]] combined his psychoanalytic and political theories in his book ''[[The Mass Psychology of Fascism]]'' in 1933.

The psychologist and philosopher [[Erich Fromm]] wrote about the psychological motivation behind political ideology, starting with ''[[The Fear of Freedom]]'' in 1941.

Another member of the Frankfurt school, [[Theodor Adorno]], published [[The Authoritarian Personality]], in 1950, which was an influential sociological book which could be taken as something of a proto-psychohistorical book.

Its first academic use appeared in [[Erik Erikson]]'s book ''Young Man Luther'' (1958), where the author called for a discipline of &quot;psycho-history&quot; to examine the impact of human character on history.

[[Lloyd deMause]] developed a formal psychohistorical approach from 1974 onwards, and continues to be an influential theorist in this field.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

===Independence as a discipline===

DeMause and others have argued that psychohistory is a separate field of scholarly inquiry with its own particular methods, objectives and theories, which set it apart from conventional historical analysis and anthropology. Some historians, social scientists and anthropologists have, however, argued that their disciplines already describe psychological motivation and that Psychohistory is not, therefore, a separate subject.  Others have dismissed deMause's theories and motives arguing that the emphasis given by Psychohistory to speculation on the psychological motivations of people in history make it an undisciplined field of study. Doubt has also been cast on the viability of the application of post-mortem psychoanalysis by Freud's followers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/reviews/shrinking-history/] Review of ''Shrinking History on Freud and the Failure of Psychohistory'' - Reviewed in 1980 by Cosma Shalizi
:'''Note:''' The book under review criticizes the Freudian approach to psychohistory. It makes no mention of deMause or The Institute for Psychohistory.&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychohistorians maintain that the difference is one of emphasis and that, in conventional study, narrative and description are central, while psychological motivation is hardly touched on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| last = Davis
| first = Glenn
| title = Childhood and History in America
| publisher = Psychohistory Pr
| year = 1976
| location = NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; For deMause, child abuse takes the center stage. Psychohistorians accuse most anthropologists and ethnologists of being apologists for incest, infanticide, [[cannibalism]] and child sacrifice.&lt;ref name=&quot;OnWriting&quot;&gt;{{cite journal  | last = deMause  | first = Lloyd  | title = On Writing Childhood History  | journal = The Journal of Psychohistory  | volume = 16 (2) Fall  | year = 1988 | url = http://www.psychohistory.com/childhood/writech1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; They maintain that what constitutes child abuse is a matter of objective fact, and that some of the practices which mainstream anthropologists apologize for (e.g., sacrificial rituals) may result in [[psychosis]], dissociation and magical thinking: particularly for the surviving children who had a sacrificed brother or sister by their parents. In a 1994 interview with deMause in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', the interviewer wrote: &quot;To buy into psychohistory, you have to subscribe to some fairly woolly assumptions [...], for instance, that a nations's child-rearing techniques affect its foreign policy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The talk of the town&quot;, ''[[The New Yorker]]'', authored by Editors of the periodical (December 5, 1994), pp. 55-56.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychohistorians also believe that [[cultural relativism]] is contrary to the letter and spirit of [[human rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Psychogenic mode==
Psychohistorians have written much about changes in the human psyche through history; changes that they believe were produced by parents, and especially the mothers' increasing capacity to empathize with their children. Key to deMause's thought is the concept of psychoclass, which emerges out of a particular style of childrearing, and child abuse, at a particular period in a society's development. The conflict of new and old psychoclasses is also highlighted in psychohistorians' thought. This is reflected, for instance, in the clash between [[Democratic party (United States)|Blue State]] and [[Republican party (United States)|Red State]] voters in the contemporary United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dervin | first = Dan | title = George W. Bush's Second Term: Saving the World, Saving the Country | journal = [[Journal of Psychohistory|The Journal of Psychohistory]] | volume = 33 | pages = 117?124 | year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = deMause | first = Lloyd | title = [Book review of] Jonathan Schell's ''The Seventh Decade'' | journal = The Journal of Psychohistory | volume = 35 | pages = 308?309 | year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another key psychohistorical concept is that of ''group fantasy'', which deMause regards as a mediating force between a psychoclass's collective childhood experiences (and the psychic conflicts emerging therefrom), and the psychoclass's behavior in politics, religion and other aspects of social life.&lt;ref name=&quot;EMOL&quot;&gt;{{cite book

A ''psychogenic mode'' in Psychohistory is a type of mentality (or ''psychoclass'') that results from, and is associated with, a particular childrearing style. The major psychogenic modes described by deMause are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20091026212029/http://www.geocities.com/kidhistory/modesw.htm ''The Evolution of Childrearing Modes'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PsFoundations&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=deMause |first=Lloyd  |authorlink=Lloyd deMause|title=Foundations of Psychohistory |url= |edition= |series= |date= |year=1982 |month=January  |publisher=Creative Roots Publishing  |location= |isbn=094050801X |oclc= |doi=  |pages=61 &amp; 132?146}}[http://www.psychohistory.com/htm/p132x146.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;th&gt;Childrearing characteristics&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Historical manifestations&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td rowspan=&quot;2&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Infanticidal&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;''[[Early infanticidal childrearing]]:''&lt;br /&gt;Ritual sacrifice. High infanticide rates, incest, body mutilation, child rape and tortures.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td rowspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;[[Child sacrifice]] and [[infanticide]] among tribal societies, [[Child sacrifice in pre-Columbian cultures|Mesoamerica and the Incas]]; in [[Assyria]]n and [[Canaan]]ite religions. [[Human_sacrifice#Phoenicia|Phoenicians, Carthaginians]] and other early states also sacrificed infants to their gods.

On the other hand, the relatively more enlightened Greeks and Romans exposed some of their babies (&quot;late&quot; infanticidal childrearing).&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;''Late infanticidal childrearing:''&lt;br /&gt;While the young child is not overly rejected by the mother, many newborn babies, especially girls, are [[Child abandonment|exposed]] to death.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Abandoning&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Early Christians considered a child as having a soul at birth, although possessed by evil tendencies. Routine infanticide was replaced by joining in the group fantasy of the sacrifice of Christ, who was sent by his father to be killed for the sins of others.&lt;ref name=&quot;PsFoundations&quot; /&gt; Routine pederasty of boys continued in monasteries and elsewhere, and the rape of girls was commonplace.&lt;ref name=&quot;EMOL&quot; /&gt;  &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Infanticide replaced by abandonment. Those children who survived the experience did not internalize a completely murderous superego. Longer [[swaddling]], [[fosterage]], outside [[Wet nurse|wetnursing]], oblation of children to monasteries and nunneries, and [[apprenticeship]].&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Ambivalent&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;The 12th century saw the first child instruction manuals and rudimentary child protection laws, although most mothers still emotionally rejected their children.&lt;ref name=&quot;PsFoundations&quot; /&gt;  Children were often treated as erotic objects by adults.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;The later Middle Ages ended abandonment of children to monasteries. [[Enema]]s, early beating, shorter swaddling, mourning for deceased children, a precursor to [[empathy]].&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Intrusive&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;During the 16th century, particularly in England, parents shifted from trying to stop children's growth to trying to control them and make them obedient. Parents were prepared to give them attention as long as they controlled their minds, their insides, their anger and the lives they led.&lt;ref name=&quot;PsFoundations&quot; /&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;The intrusive parent began to unswaddle the infant. Early toilet training, [[Psychological repression|repression]] of child's sexuality. [[Hell]] threats turned into the Puritan child so familiar from early modern childrearing literature. On the other hand, the end of swaddling and wet-nursing made possible the explosive modern takeoff in scientific advance.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Socializing&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Beginning in the 18th century, mothers began to actually enjoy child care, and fathers began to participate in younger children's development.&lt;ref name=&quot;PsFoundations&quot; /&gt; The aim remained instilling parental goals rather than encouraging individuation. [[Psychological manipulation]] and [[spanking]] were used to make children obedient. Hellfire and the harsher physical disciplinary actions using objects to beat the child disappeared.&lt;ref name=&quot;PsFoundations&quot; /&gt;  The Socializing Mode remains the most popular model of parenting in North America and Western Europe to the present day.  &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Use of guilt, &quot;mental discipline&quot;, [[humiliation]], rise of [[Compulsory education|compulsory schooling]], delegation of parental unconscious wishes. As parental injections continued to diminish, the rearing of the child became less a process of conquering its will than of training it. The socializing psychoclass built the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;PsFoundations&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Helping&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Beginning in the mid-20th century, some parents adopted the role of helping children reach their own goals in life, rather than &quot;[[socialize]]&quot; them into fulfilling parental wishes. Less psychological manipulation, more unconditional love. Children raised in this way are far more empathic towards others in society than earlier generations.&lt;ref name=&quot;PsFoundations&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;[[Children's rights movement]], [[deschooling]] and [[Anarchistic free school|free schooling]], [[natural childbirth]], [[Taking Children Seriously]] and the abandonment of [[circumcision]].&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Psychohistorians maintain that the six modes of abusive childrearing (excluding the &quot;helping mode&quot;) are [[Trauma model of mental disorders#Psychohistory table|related to psychiatric disorders]] from psychoses to neuroses.

The chart below shows the dates at which these modes are believed to have evolved in the most advanced nations, based on contemporary accounts from historical records. A black-and-white version of the chart appears in ''Foundations of Psychohistory''.&lt;ref name=&quot;PsFoundations&quot; /&gt;&lt;!-- p. 61 --&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Image-Evolution of psychogenic modes.png|centre]]

The timeline doesn't apply to [[hunter-gatherer]] societies. It doesn't apply either to the [[Greece|Greek]] and [[Rome|Roman]] world, where there was a wide variation in childrearing practices. It is notable that the arrival of the ''Ambivalent'' mode of child-rearing preceded the start of the [[Renaissance]] (mid 14th century) by only one or two generations, and the arrival of the ''Socializing'' mode coincided with the [[Age of Enlightenment]], which began in the late 18th century.

Reports of [[selective abortion]] (and sometimes [[Sex-selective abortion and infanticide|exposure of baby girls]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gendercide.org/case_infanticide.html Female Infanticide]&lt;/ref&gt; especially in [[China]], [[Korea]], [[Taiwan]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]], New Guinea, and many other developing countries in [[Asia]] and [[North Africa]]&lt;ref&gt;A.

New York:  McGraw-Hill, pp. 200f.&lt;/ref&gt; explain why millions of women are &quot;missing&quot; in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Goodkind, Daniel. (1999).

''Population Studies, 53 (1),'' 49-61.&lt;/ref&gt; From the psychohistorical view, this demonstrates that the earlier forms of childrearing coexist with later modes, even in the most advanced countries. However, the chart should not be regarded as an accurate representation of the relative prevalence of each mode in the present day, as it is not based on large-scale, formal surveys.

According to psychohistory theory, each of the six psychoclasses co-exists in the [[modern world]] today, and, regardless of the changes in the environment, it is only when changes in childhood occur that societies begin to progress.

The Y-Axis on the above chart serves as an indicator of the new stage and not a measurement of the stage's size or relation to the x-axis.

===A psychoclass for postmodern times===

According to the psychogenic theory, since [[Neanderthal man]] most tribes and families practiced infanticide, child mutilation, incest and beating of their children throughout prehistory and history.  Presently the Western socializing mode of childrearing is considered much less abusive in the field, though this mode is not yet entirely free of abuse. In the opening paragraph of his seminal essay &quot;The Evolution of Childhood&quot; (first article in ''The History of Childhood''), DeMause states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The history of childhood is a nightmare from which we have only recently begun to awaken.  The further back in history one goes, the lower the level of childcare, and the more likely children are to be killed, abandoned, beaten, terrorized and sexually abused.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is notwithstanding an optimistic trait in the field. In a world of &quot;helping mode&quot; parents, deMause believes, violence of any other sort will disappear as well, along with [[magical thinking]], mental disorders, wars and other inhumanities of man against man. Although, the criticism has been made that this itself is a form of magical thinking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://primal-page.com/ps4.htm The evolution of psyche and society] - deMause's explanatory chapter of ''The Emotional Life of Nations'' (op. cit.).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
There are no departments dedicated to &quot;psychohistory&quot; in any institution of higher learning, though some history departments have run courses in it. Psychohistory remains a [[Controversy|controversial]] field of study, and deMause and other psychohistorians face criticism in the academic community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Stannard, David E. |title=Shrinking History: On Freud and the Failure of Psychohistory |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |location= |year=1982 |pages= |isbn=0-19-503044-3 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Eysenck |first=Hans Jurgen |authorlink= Hans Eysenck |title=Decline and Fall of the Freudian Empire |url=http://books.google.com/?id=oFbO0EDgBikC&amp;pg=PA171&amp;lpg=PA171&amp;dq=anthropology+psychohistory |accessdate= |publisher=Transaction Publishers |isbn=0765809451 |chapter=7 Psycho-babble and Pseudo-History |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pomper |first=Philip  |year=1973 |title=Problems of a Naturalistic Psychohistory  |journal=History and Theory |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=367?388 |doi=10.2307/2504699|jstor=2504699}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hunt |first=Lynn |editor=Kramer Lloyd S. and Maza, Sarah C.|title=A Companion to Western Historical Thought |url=http://books.google.com/?id=E2eKDjo4B_IC&amp;pg=PA339&amp;lpg=PA339&amp;dq=psychohistory+is+a+pseudoscience |year=2002 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |isbn=0631217142 |pages=337?357 |chapter=Psychology, Pschoanalysis and Historical Thought -The Misfortunes of Psychohistory }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Paul  | first = Robert A.  | title = Review of Lloyd deMause's Foundations of Psychohistory  | journal = Journal of Psychoanalytic Anthropology  | volume = 5  | pages = 469  | year = 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; DeMause's formulations have been criticized for being insufficiently supported by credible research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Demos  | first = John  | title = &quot;Child Abuse in Context: An Historian's Perspective&quot;.

The discipline has the advantage of being able to deal with [[Motivation|motive]] in history and is useful in developing narratives, but is forced to psychoanalyse its subjects after the fact, which was not considered when the theory was developed and expanded.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Recent psychohistory has also been criticized for being overly-entangled with DeMause, whose theories do not speak for the entire field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://users.ids.net/~marcom/historint/hi-methodnotes.html   |title=Historical Sources On Line - A weblography  of  Historical Sources on the Internet |accessdate=March 2008 |author=Marc Comtois }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1974 book in which deMause included essays of nine professional historians, ''The History of Childhood'', offers a survey of the treatment of children through history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=DeMause L | authorlink = Lloyd deMause |title=The History of Childhood (The Master Work) |publisher=Jason Aronson |location=Northvale, N.J |year=1995 |pages= |isbn=1-56821-551-7 |oclc= |doi=| coauthors = Lyman RB, McLaughlin, MM et al.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although critics generally spare these nine historians, they see deMause as a strong proponent of the &quot;black legend&quot; view of childhood history (i.e. that the history of childhood was above all a history of progress, with children being far more often badly mistreated in the past).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Aries  | first = Philippe  | title = De l'enfant roi a l'enfant martyr  | journal = Revue Psychologie  | volume = 68  | pages = 6  | year = 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, his work has been criticized for being a history of child abuse, not childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Heywood  | first = Colin  | title = A History of Childhood  | publisher = Polity Press  | year = 2001  | location = Cambridge  | pages = 41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The History of Childhood'', authored by ten scholars (including deMause), is often linked to Edward Shorter's ''The Making of the Modern Family'' and [[Lawrence Stone]]'s ''The Family, Sex and Marriage in England 1500-1800'', because of the common ground they share in agreeing with a grim perspective of childhood history. But deMause's work in particular has attracted hostility from historian Hugh Cunningham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cunningham  | first = Hugh  | title = Children and Childhood in Western Society since 1500  | publisher = Longman | year = 1995 | location = London  | pages = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Kohut went even further:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The reader is doubtless already familiar with examples of these psychohistorical &quot;abuses.&quot; There is a significant difference, however, between the well-meaning and serious, if perhaps simplistic and reductionistic, attempt to understand the psychological in history and the psychohistorical expose that can at times verge on historical pornography. For examples of the more frivolous and distasteful sort of psychohistory, see ''[[The Journal of Psychohistory]]''. For more serious and scholarly attempts to understand the psychological dimension of the past, see ''The Psychohistory Review''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Kohut  | first = Thomas A.  | title = Psychohistory as History  | jstor = 1858137  | journal = The American Historical Review  | volume = 91  | issue = 2  | pages = 336?354  | year = 1986  | doi = 10.2307/1858137  | pmid = 11611943}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

DeMause and the psychohistorians respond that their detractors are not largely moved by evidence, but rather are unconsciously motivated to attack those who would challenge the idea of &quot;good parenting&quot; even in very primitive tribes or cultures.&lt;ref name=&quot;OnWriting&quot;/&gt;

==Organizations==
The principal center for psychohistorical study is The Institute for Psychohistory founded by Lloyd deMause which has 19 branches around the globe and has for over 30 years published the ''[[Journal of Psychohistory|The Journal of Psychohistory]]''.

The International Psychohistorical Association founded by [[Lloyd deMause]] in 1977 is the professional organization for the field of psychohistory. It publishes ''Psychohistory News'' and has a psychohistorical mail order lending library. It hosts an annual convention.

A course in Psychohistory has been taught at a three universities at the undergraduate level. The following have published course details: [[Boston University]], [[City University of New York]] and [[Wesleyan University]].&lt;ref&gt;Boston University has a Psychohistory Course. See [http://www.bu.edu/bridge/archive/2003/10-31/psycho.html] and CAS HI 503 at [http://www.bu.edu/history/crsinven.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wesleyan.edu/course/hist251f.htm Wesleyan University, Middletown, Connecticut has a course.

Parachronism

{{unreferenced|date=May 2009}}A '''parachronism''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] &quot;''????'',&quot; &quot;on the side,&quot; and &quot;''??????'',&quot; &quot;time&quot;) is anything that appears in a [[Time|temporal]] context (time period) in which, though not sufficiently out of place as to be impossible, it is not normally found. The item is often an object, but may be an idiomatic expression, a technology, a philosophical idea, a musical style, a material, a custom, or anything else sufficiently closely bound to a particular period as to seem strange when encountered in a later era.
Parachronisms are objects or ideas which were once common, but are now considered rare or inappropriate. They often take the form of obsolete technology or outdated fashion. This is different from a [[prochronism]], in which the object or idea has not yet been invented when the situation takes place, and therefore could not have existed at the time. Thus a suburban housewife in the United States around 1960 would not ordinarily use a [[washboard]] for laundry after [[washing machine]]s had become the norm, and few teenagers of that time would be listening to [[ragtime]] music.

'''Chronology''' (from [[Latin]] ''chronologia'', from [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wikt:??????|??????]]}}, ''chronos'', &quot;time&quot;; and {{lang|grc|-?????}}, ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]'') is the science of arranging events in their order of occurrence in [[time]], such as the use of a [[timeline]] or [[sequence of events]]. It is also &quot;the determination of the actual temporal sequence of past events&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;wordnet&quot;&gt;Memidex/WordNet, &quot;chronology,&quot; [http://www.memidex.com/chronology+humanistic-discipline memidex.com] (accessed September 25, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Chronology is part of [[periodization]]. It is also part of the discipline of [[history]], including [[earth history]], the [[earth sciences]], and study of the [[geologic time scale]] (see [[#Prehistoric chronologies|Prehistoric chronologies]] below).

==Related fields==
Chronology is the science of locating historical events in time, basically a time line and is distinct from, but relies upon [[chronometry]] or timekeeping, and [[historiography]], which examines the writing of history and the use of historical methods. [[Radiocarbon dating]] estimates the age of formerly living things by measuring the proportion of [[carbon-14]] [[isotope]] in their [[carbon]] content. [[Dendrochronology]] estimates the age of trees by [[correlation]] of the various [[growth rings]] in their wood to known year-by-year reference sequences in the region to reflect year-to-year climatic variation. Dendrochronology is used in turn as a [[calibration]] reference for [[radiocarbon dating]] curves.

==Calendar and era==
{{calendars}}
{{Main|Calendar}}
The familiar terms ''[[calendar]]'' and ''[[era]]'' (within the meaning of a coherent system of numbered calendar years) concern two complementary fundamental concepts of chronology. For example during eight centuries the calendar belonging to the [[Christian era]], which era was taken in use in the eighth century by [[Bede]], was the Julian calendar, but after the year 1582 it was the Gregorian calendar. [[Dionysius Exiguus]] (about the year 500) was the founder of that era, which is nowadays the most widespread dating system on earth.

===Ab Urbe condita era===
{{Main|Ab urbe condita}}
''Ab Urbe condita'' is [[Latin]] for &quot;from [[founding of Rome|the founding]] of the City ([[Rome]])&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Literally translated as &quot;From the city having been founded&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; traditionally set in 753 BC. It was used to identify the Roman year by a few Roman historians. Modern historians use it much more frequently than the Romans themselves did; the dominant method of identifying Roman years was to name the two [[consul]]s who held office that year. Before the advent of the modern critical edition of historical Roman works, AUC was indiscriminately added to them by earlier editors, making it appear more widely used than it actually was.

It was used systematically for the first time only about the year 400, by the Iberian historian [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]. [[Pope Boniface IV]], in about the year 600, seems to have been the first who made a connection between these this era and [[Anno Domini]]. (AD 1 = AUC 754.)

===Astronomical era===
{{Main|Astronomical year numbering}}
Dionysius Exiguus? Anno Domini era (which contains only calendar years ''AD'') was extended by [[Bede]] to the complete [[Christian]] era (which contains, in addition all calendar years ''BC'', but no ''year zero''). Ten centuries after Bede, the French astronomers [[La Hire|Philippe de la Hire]] (in the year 1702) and [[Jacques Cassini]] (in the year 1740), purely to simplify certain calculations, put the [[Julian Date|Julian Dating System]] (proposed in the year 1583 by [[Joseph Scaliger]]) and with it an astronomical era into use, which contains a [[leap year]] zero, which precedes the year 1 (AD) but does not exactly coincide with the year 1 BC. Astronomers never preposed seriously to replace our era with their astronomical era (which for that matter coincides exactly with the Christian era where it concerns the calendar years ''after'' the year 4).

==Prehistoric chronologies==
While of critical importance to the historian, methods of determining chronology are used in most disciplines of science, especially [[astronomy]], [[geology]], [[paleontology]] and [[archaeology]].

In the absence of [[written history]], with its [[chronicle]]s and [[:Category:King lists|king list]]s, late 19th century archaeologists found that they could develop relative chronologies based on pottery techniques and styles. In the field of [[Egyptology]], [[William Flinders Petrie]] pioneered sequence dating to penetrate pre-dynastic [[Neolithic]] times, using groups of contemporary artefacts deposited together at a single time in graves and working backwards methodically from the earliest historical phases of Egypt. This method of dating is known as [[Seriation (archaeology)|seriation]].

Known wares discovered at strata in sometimes quite distant sites, the product of trade, helped extend the network of chronologies. Some cultures have retained the name applied to them in reference to characteristic forms, for lack of an idea of what they called themselves: &quot;The [[Beaker People]]&quot; in northern Europe during the [[3rd millennium BCE]], for example. The study of the means of placing pottery and other cultural artifacts into some kind of order proceeds in two phases, classification and typology: Classification creates categories for the purposes of description, and typology seeks to identify and analyse changes that allow artifacts to be placed into sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Greene | first =Kevin | authorlink = | title =Archaeology : An Introduction | publisher =University of Newcastle Upon Tyne | month =November | year =2007 | location = | pages = Chapter 4 | url =http://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/kevin.greene/wintro/chap4.htm | isbn = | accessdate =2008-01-04 | nopp =true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laboratory techniques developed particularly after mid-20th century helped constantly revise and refine the chronologies developed for specific cultural areas. Unrelated dating methods help reinforce a chronology, an axiom of corroborative [[evidence]]. Ideally, archaeological materials used for dating a site should complement each other and provide a means of cross-checking. Conclusions drawn from just one unsupported technique are usually regarded as unreliable.

==Chronological analysis==
Several legendary sources tend to assign unrealistically long lifespans to pre-historical heroes and monarchs (''e.g.'', Egyptian, Chinese, Hebrews, Japanese), if the number of years there reported are understood as years of more than 340 days. Though chronologies formulated before the 1960s are subject to serious skepticism today, more recent results are more robust than readily appears to journalists and enthusiastic amateurs. [[Bayesian inference]] can be applied in the analysis of chronological information, including radiocarbon-derived dates.

But it was popularized by [[Leon Trotsky]] in response to the [[Menshevik]]s  walking out of the [[Congress of the CPSU|Second Congress of Soviets]], on October 25, 1903 ([[Julian calendar]]), thereby enabling the [[Bolshevik]]s to establish their dominance.

It has since been used in both the direct and the ironic sense in political and nonpolitical contexts.

Later, it was most notably used by [[Ronald Reagan]] in a speech to the [[British House of Commons]] on June 8, 1982.  Reagan's speechwriter chose the expression deliberately because of its prior context. His exact phrase was: &quot;... freedom and democracy will leave [[Marxism]] and [[Leninism]] on the ash heap of history.&quot;

A '''memory hole''' is any mechanism for the alteration or disappearance of inconvenient or embarrassing documents, photographs, transcripts, or other records, such as from a [[web site]] or other archive, particularly as part of an attempt to give the impression that something never happened.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murphy&quot;&gt;[http://firedoglake.com/2010/05/31/memorial-day-memory-hole-after-israel-forgets-exodus-white-house-forgets-shores-of-tripoli-will-obama-remember-nato/ Murphy, Kirk, ''Memorial Day Memory Hole: After Israel Forgets ?Exodus?, White House Forgets ?Shores of Tripoli?. Will Obama Remember NATO?''  May 31, 2010 [[Firedoglake]].com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mother&quot;&gt;[http://motherjones.com/mojo/2010/06/nevada-tea-partier-memory-hole-website-sharron-angle-harry-reid-senate Weinstein, Adam, ''Nevada Tea Partier's Memory Hole'' June 9, 2010]. [[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]].&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was first popularized by [[George Orwell]]'s [[dystopian]] novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.

==Origins==
In ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' the memory hole is a small chute leading to a large [[incinerator]] used for [[censorship]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newspeakdictionary.com/ns-dict.html &quot;Memory Hole&quot;, the Newspeak Dictionary.]&lt;/ref&gt;:

{{quote|In the walls of the cubicle there were three orifices. To the right of the speakwrite, a small [[pneumatic tube]] for written messages, to the left, a larger one for newspapers; and in the side wall, within easy reach of Winston's arm, a large oblong slit protected by a wire grating. This last was for the disposal of waste paper. Similar slits existed in thousands or tens of thousands throughout the building, not only in every room but at short intervals in every corridor. For some reason they were nicknamed memory holes. When one knew that any document was due for destruction, or even when one saw a scrap of waste paper lying about, it was an automatic action to lift the flap of the nearest memory hole and drop it in, whereupon it would be whirled away on a current of warm air to the enormous furnaces which were hidden somewhere in the recesses of the building.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 34-35.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the novel, the memory hole is a slot into which government officials deposit politically inconvenient documents and records to be destroyed. ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'''s protagonist [[Winston Smith]], who works in the [[Ministry of Truth]], is routinely assigned the task of revising old newspaper articles in order to serve the propaganda interests of the government.

For example, if the government had pledged that the [[chocolate]] [[Rationing|ration]] would not fall below the current 30 [[grams]] per week, but in fact the ration is reduced to 20&amp;nbsp;grams per week, the historical record (for example, an article from a back issue of the ''Times'' newspaper) is revised to contain an announcement that a reduction to 20&amp;nbsp;grams might soon prove necessary, or that the ration, then 15&amp;nbsp;grams, would soon be increased to that number. The original copies of the historical record are deposited into the memory hole.

A document placed in the memory hole is supposedly transported to an incinerator from which &quot;not even the ash remains&quot;. However, as with almost all claims made by the Party in this novel, the truth is left ambiguous and the reader is not told whether the documents are truly destroyed. For example, a photograph which Winston throws into one early in the novel is produced later during his torture session by O'Brien, who then throws it back, moments later denying having any memory that the event had even occurred. This draws a direct parallel with the Party's general philosophy of doublethink, of which the memory hole is in a sense the physical embodiment; as the novel describes it, &quot;to forget, whatever it was necessary to forget, then to draw it back into memory again at the moment when it was needed, and then promptly to forget it again&quot;.

Transformation of culture
</title>

</id>
<text>
'''Transformation of culture''', or '''cultural change''',  to the dynamic process whereby the living [[culture]]s of the world are changing and adapting to external or internal forces. This process is occurring within [[Western culture]] as well as non-Western and [[indigenous cultures]] and cultures of the world. Forces which contribute to the cultural change described in this article include: [[colonization]], [[globalization]], advances in [[communication]], [[transport]] and [[infrastructure]] improvements, and [[military]] expansion.==Theories of cultural change==
Various scholars have proposed different theories of cultural change. [[Thomas R. Rochon]] proposed a differentiation between three modes of cultural change:&lt;ref name=Rochon&gt;Thomas R. Rochon, ''Culture Moves: Ideas, Activism, and Changing Values'', Princeton U. Press, 1998, ISBN 0691011575, p.55-56&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''value conversion''' ? the replacement of existing cultural values with new ones (ex. changing views of [[slavery]] as an acceptable practice to an abhorrent one)&lt;ref name=Rochon/&gt;
* '''value creation''' ? the development of new ideas to apply to new situations (ex. emergence of the environmental issues or concepts such as [[sexual harassment]])&lt;ref name=Rochon/&gt;
* '''value connection''' ? the development of a conceptual link between phenomena previously thought unconnected or connected in a different way

== Transformation of Western culture ==
&quot;Western&quot; or [[European culture]] began to undergo rapid change starting with the arrival of [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] in the [[New World]], and continuing with the [[industrial revolution]]. The [[Modern era|Modern Period]], from 1914?1945, is characterized as a highly transformative era, with [[World War I]] serving as the watershed moment initiating and forever marking the [[Modern]] period.&lt;ref&gt;Professor Robert Hershey, at the [[University of Arizona James E. Rogers College of Law|James E. Rogers College of Law]] expands on this concept and how it relates to transformation of cultures in his [[globalization]] course.&lt;/ref&gt; In literature, the work of the High [[Modernists]] ruled this period. Notable High Modernists include: [[T.S. Elliot]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Gertrude Stein]], [[Ezra Pound]], and [[James Joyce]]. The High Modernists were predominantly American [[expatriates]] living abroad after the war and strongly marked by the war experience. A great deal of literature was written attempting to convey the [[World War I]] experience. Among these is Ezra Pound's poem, &quot;Hugh Selwyn Mauberley&quot;, published in 1920. The poem points out the perceived pointlessness of World War I, but also the loss of faith in the [[British Empire]] and Western ideals. Another example of literature during this time is the anti-war poem &quot;Dulce et Decorum Est.&quot;, written by [[Wilfred Owen]]. This poem contests the deep-seated tradition of ''noblesse oblige'', and questions the idea of dying for one's country. The 1960s were a tumultuous time in Western culture, especially in Europe due to the severe restructuring necessary following the aftermath of the [[Second World War]] and in the United States due to its controversial participation in both the [[Cold War]] and South East Asian political affairs with the [[Vietnam War]], where the US role was perceived from a numer of directions as prolonging the residual effects of decades of colonial patronization in the Asian region by economically well to do European powers. This period was marked by a number of nascent social changes including a hightened sensitivity to the futility of war which sparked hundreds of protest marches and popular uprisings on a world-wide scale, rising tides of awareness concerning the need to change overwhelmingly negative [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]-relations in the USA, experimental drug use, a new genre in popular music, and a general shift away from social normatives of previous generations. Out of this era stemmed some of today's most powerful forces, such as the internet. The internet was created in large part by people cooperating, taking chances, and experimenting outside of corporate settings. Many of the individuals who were drawn to the technology in its infancy were activists and progressives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= | first= | authorlink= | coauthors= | title= How the 60s Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry | publisher=Penguin Group | year=2005 | location= New York, NY | pages= | url= | doi= | id= | isbn=0670033820}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars and social theorists recognize that we are undergoing another cultural change brought about by the [[New Industrial Revolution]]. This Revolution is changing the way that products are made and disposed of,&lt;ref&gt;[[William McDonough]] &amp; Michael Braungart, ''Cradle to Cradle'' (North Point Press, New York 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; how buildings are constructed, and our relationship to the natural world and its capital.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Hawkins (politician)|Paul Hawkins]], Amory Lovins &amp; L. Hunter Lovins, ''Natural Capitalism'' (Little, Brown and Company, New York 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; See also: [[segregation laws]], [[conscription|conscientious objection]], May 1968.

== Transformation of indigenous cultures ==
Many of the themes discussed in the context of transformation of [[cultures]] and cultural change have particular urgency for the world's [[indigenous peoples]]. Indigenous systems of collective economic production and distribution do
not conform to [[capitalism|capitalism's]] emphasis on individual accumulation. This phenomenon is not new, although processes of [[globalization]] have increased the scale and frequency of such conflicts of perspective. The contradictions between indigenous and capitalist modes of production, and the tensions generated by their intersection, have deep historical roots in the process of [[colonization]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Wolf]] (1982), Europe and the People Without History. Univ. of California Press, LA.&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, the two worldviews are indeed antithetical. Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, an Igorot [[activist]] from the [[Philippines]], summarizes the difference when she writes that &quot;[[industrialized]] [[culture]] regards our [[value (personal and cultural)|values]] as unscientific obstacles to [[modernization]] and thus worthy of ridicule, suppression, and denigration. The [[Industrial Revolution|industrial world]] also views our [[political]], [[social]], and land-tenure [[traditions]] as dangerous: our collective identities; our communal ownership of [[forests]], [[water]]s, and lands; our usufruct system of [[community]] sharing, and our consensus decision-making are all antithetical to the capitalist hallmarks of individualism and private [[property]].&quot; &lt;ref&gt;from &quot;Our Right to Remain Separate and Distinct&quot; In PARADIGM WARS: INDIGENOUS PEOPLES' RESISTANCE TO ECONOMIC GLOBALIZATION (hereafter &quot;PARADIGM WARS&quot;) 10-11. (Jerry Mander and Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, eds., 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Many indigenous peoples view &quot;[[resources]]&quot; in a very different way from that of global industry's [[commodity]]-centered calculus. A leader of the Indigenous Network on Economies and Trade, Secwepemc author Arthur Manuel writes: &quot;Mainstream [[economists]] tend to value [[economic development|development]] strategies solely in terms of their [[wealth]] generation potential for [[industry]] and [[governments]]. So resources are viewed in strictly monetary terms. But indigenous peoples consider the value of land and resources in far broader, more integrated terms, including cultural, social, spiritual and environmental values, and their [[sustainability]]. Among indigenous peoples, decisions about caring for resources and the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] are usually made as part of a collective process, where the community takes into account a full spectrum of values and benefits other than short-term economic gains&quot;&lt;ref&gt;(Manuel 2005: 177). From &quot;Indigenous Brief to WTO: How the Denial of Aboriginal Title Serves as an Illegal Export Subsidy.&quot; In PARADIGM WARS 177. (Jerry Mander and Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, eds., 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Around the world many indigenous groups have over centuries or millennia successfully sustained economies in one particular place and [[ecosystem]]. The co-adaptation of people with other elements of their [[ecological]] systems has meant that the integrity and functioning of these systems has been sustained even as the communities' culture developed and changed historically. These economic arrangements are viewed as one component of a cultural understandings that include [[sacred]] interactions with the world.&lt;ref&gt;For an attempt to correlate levels of knowledge of an ecosystem with the number of [[generations]] that a people have been living in a particular place, and a description of the means by which knowledge of [[sustainable]] [[economic]] practices becomes incorporated into the sacred practices and [[beliefs]] of a community, see F. Berkes, C. Folke, and M. Gadgil, Traditional Ecological Knowledge: [[Biodiversity]], Resilience, and Sustainability. In BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION 281-289. (C.A. Perry, ed.) (Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous economies can thus be seen to be sustainable to the extent to which the holders of culture interact in a culturally appropriate way with the world around them, including those elements of the world known to modern scientists as &quot;natural resources&quot;. In many areas indigenous people have sustained communities for centuries, and the ecological systems of which they are a component have maintained relative richness and resilience to natural perturbations such as drought or fires. The ecosystems that have been remained predominantly under control and care of indigenous peoples thus tend to be characterized by high [[biodiversity]], abundant renewable resources, and relatively unexploited nonrenewable resources. For many indigenous groups, the advent of globalization threatens the sustainability of their economies by making their land and knowledge valuable targets as commodities in a globalized economy.

== Environmental stresses and impacts on cultures ==
Cultures around the world are undergoing change due to environmental stresses, such as [[climate change]]. [[Globalization]] and increased [[consumerism]] are increasing environmental stress by contributing to [[deforestation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jensen &amp; George Draffan | first = Derrick | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Strangely Like War: The Global Assault on Forests | publisher = Chelsea Green Publishing | year = 2004 | location = White River Jct., Vermont | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 9781931498456}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to deforestation, other stresses such as introduction of foreign species,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Barringer | first = Felicity | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Where There's No Room for All Three of Them | publisher = NY Times | date = March 5, 2004 | location = | pages = sec.

Rev. | year = 1999 | location = | pages = 57 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Indigenous resistance ==
In many cases, however, [[indigenous people]] have not passively acceded to the penetration of extractive capitalism into their communities. The following section thus not only reviews how [[globalization]] impacts indigenous people, but also describes how indigenous communities resist or negotiate to defend their territories and cultural integrity.

[[Economic policy]], when set on a global scale, can undermine the political gains that indigenous peoples may have made within the [[legal systems]] of nation states. Victor Menotti of the International Forum on Globalization has written of how [[World Trade Organization]](WTO) authority is diminishing the [[sovereignty]] of nation states over their land, [[water]], [[genetic material]], and public services.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Menotti. ''How the World Trade Organization (WTO) Diminishes Native Sovereignty''. In ''Paradigm Wars'', 46-57. (Jerry Mander and Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, eds., 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), for example, favors the privatization of systems (such as those for water distribution) that serve the general public but without an equitable provision of services that is often at odds with maximization of profits.&lt;ref&gt;Investment in [[infrastructure]] to provide [[water]] to a small village, for example, may not make business sense if the number of users is too small or too poor to provide a return on the initial [[construction]] costs. A national or local [[government agency]] may choose to pursue such a project either out of [[social responsibility]] or in response to [[politics|political]] pressure, but a private [[company]] is less likely to do so. Additionally, costs of basic services such as [[water]] often rise under [[privatization]] as companies seek to increase [[Profit (economics)|profits]], a change that can result in a loss of access for poor people. ''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Structural Adjustment Programs]] (SAPs) imposed as a condition of loans from global [[finance]] agencies such as the [[World Bank]] also often mandate [[privatization]]. The effects on indigenous peoples and other poor people can be devastating. World Bank-mandated SAP [[privatization]] of [[coal mining]] in the [[India]]n state of [[Orissa]] in the 1990s, for example, resulted in [[contamination]] of [[rivers]], increased rates of [[fluoride]] [[poison]]ing, [[infections]], and [[cancer]], displacement of towns, and power rates that increased by 500%.&lt;ref&gt;Victoria Tauli-Corpuz. ''World Bank and IMF Impacts on Indigenous Economies''. In Paradigm Wars, 40. (Jerry Mander and Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, eds., 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; The World Bank and IMF have also made [[water privatization]] a prior condition for granting loans and debt reductions.&lt;ref&gt;Antonia Juhasz. ''Global Water Wars''. In Paradigm Wars, 88-93. (Jerry Mander and Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, eds., 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Structural adjustment programs also weaken national-level environmental and labor laws that indigenous communities may have relied on in previous struggles to maintain control over territory and resources.&lt;ref&gt;Tauli-Corpuz, 42-43. For a specific overview of how a SAP resulted in an impoverishment of small-scale [[farmers]] as measured by household [[nutrition]] studies, see Wycliffe Chilowa, ''The Impact of Agricultural Liberalization on Food Security in Malawi''. FOOD POLICY. 23(6): 553-569. (1998). For an examination of how
SAPs lead to [[Environment (biophysical)|environmental]] degradation as rural people are forced into vulnerable situations, see David Kaimowitz, Graham Thiele, and Pablo Pacheco, ''The Effects of Structural Adjustment on Deforestation and Forest Degradation
in Lowland Bolivia''. WORLD DEVELOPMENT. 27(3): 505-520. (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

Other new international trade rules also negatively impact indigenous peoples. For example, Article I of GATT prohibits national governments from restricting [[imports|imported goods]] specifically from any single other [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] member nation. This article thus makes it impossible for national [[governments]] to restrict imports from other WTO countries with questionable [[human rights]], [[Labor relations|labor]], or [[Environment (biophysical)|environmental]] records and thus disallows a potential safeguard for the rights of indigenous peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Menotti. ''How the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) Diminishes Native Sovereignty''. In Paradigm Wars 48. (Jerry Mander and Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, eds., 2005). Chillingly, Menotti notes that under current [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade|GATT]] rules it would thus have been impossible to [[boycott]] [[South Africa]]n goods during [[apartheid]].&lt;/ref&gt; Article III of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade|GATT]], together with its corollary Articles V and XI, requires governments to treat all imports &quot;no less favorably&quot; than locally produced goods and bans restrictions on imports. Victor Menotti writes of how this feature of [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade|GATT]] &quot;prevents any government from favoring or protecting it own local [[industries]], or [[farmers]] or [[cultures]] that might otherwise by overwhelmed by globe-spanning [[corporations]] bringing vast amounts of cheap imports that make local or indigenous economies non-viable&quot;. Similar &quot;free trade&quot; policies under NAFTA have already been demonstrated to undercut the livelihoods of small-scale [[Mexican people|Mexican]] [[maize|corn]] farmers, many of whom are indigenous, who are unable
to compete with cheap, mass-produced [[grain]] from the [[United States|US]].&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalo Fanjul and Arabella Fraser. ''Dumping without Borders: How U.S. Agricultural Policies are Destroying the Livelihoods of [[Mexican people|Mexican]] [[Maize|Corn]] Farmers''. OXFAM BRIEFING PAPER NO. 50. (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technological impacts ==
[[Technological innovation]]s can enhance, displace or devalue human existence and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Marx | first = Leo | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Machine in the Garden: Technology and the Pastoral Idea in America | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1964 | location = Oxford, New York | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Advances in medical technology have contributed to [[demographic]] changes, including increased longevity and decreasing fertility. For example, although China has slowed its population increases through a [[One-child policy|one-child per family policy]], the [[median]] age of its people will soar in the next 35 years.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Kahn, ''The Most Populous Nation Faces a Population Crisis'', NY Times, May 30, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
In some Third World countries, kidneys, eyes and skin are sold in a flourishing market for body parts.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Kimbrell, The Patenting of Life and the Global Market on Body Parts, in ''The Case Against the Global Economy and for a Turn Toward the Local'' 141-144 (J. Mander &amp; E. Goldsmith), eds. 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also rising concern amongst many{{quantify|date=November 2010}} [[indigenous people]] groups over the interrelated issues of genetic patenting and [[biopiracy]]. For example, a [[Guaymi]] woman was diagnosed with [[leukemia]] in 1991. Whilst in hospital in the city of [[Panama]] she had blood samples taken and without her knowledge or free, prior, and informed consent. The cell-line enclosed in these samples was stored, &quot;immortalized&quot;, [[patented]], and put up for sale at a price of $136 US dollars. The scientists involved in this process claimed to have &quot;invented&quot; this woman's cell-line. Their rationale for taking the samples and processing them for patenting was that these samples held &quot;commercial promise&quot; in the scientific world for the discovery of potential medical breakthroughs and that the government{{which?|date=November 2010}} encourages the patenting of anything which may have a link to such a discovery. The main contention in the debate apart from [[ethical]] dilemmas over genetic research is the fact that the woman from whom the samples were taken was never consulted about the process, so in effect, the whole process was done without her knowing it was going on or understanding what was happening to her.&lt;ref&gt;Whitt, L. Science, Colonialism, and Indigenous Peoples: The Cultural Politics of Law and Knowledge, 2009, Cambridge University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;  This presents an additional dilemma alongside the issue of [[genetic manipulation]]: [[freedom of information]].  There is also the implication of &quot;why her&quot;, &quot;why an indigenous Guaymi woman and not a Euro-American&quot;. This type of technological case-in-point presents as a more recent dilemma for indigenous groups because commonly, such failure to properly inform insofar as the impact of either scientific research endeavours or corporate-style [[Business development|development]] schemes are concerned has historically tended to coincide with policies and paradigms of practice which have their basis in [[racial discrimination]].{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

On the more positive side, certain technological innovations such as computers, the Internet, and miscellaneous sound and visual [[recording medium|recording media]] have been welcomed and embraced by indigenous peoples as a means of communicating to wider society their concerns about the dilemmas not only faced by them but by the whole world in view of the extent of [[socioeconomic]], cultural and political transformations that have continued to evolve and impact global diversity in far-reaching and often unpredictable ways.

'''Popular history''' is a broad and somewhat ill-defined [[genre]] of [[historiography]] that takes a popular approach, aims at a wide readership, and usually emphasizes [[narrative]], [[Personality type|personality]] and vivid detail over scholarly analysis. The term is used in contradistinction to professional academic or scholarly history writing which is usually more specialized and technical and, thus, less accessible to the general reader.Some '''popular historians''' are without academic affiliation while others are academics, or former academics, that have (according to one writer) ?become somehow abstracted from the academic arena, becoming cultural commentators?&lt;ref&gt; De Groot, Jerome (2009), [http://books.google.com/books?id=hexpdOj8t80C&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=%22popular+historian%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yvNFz2kvUh&amp;sig=io51iX8gENuqr0egzP2J9JpLwGM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZBSxSpqCKYmf8Qbh7MHCDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22popular%20historian%22&amp;f=false ''Consuming History: Historians and Heritage in Contemporary Popular Culture''], [[Routledge]], pg 15.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Popular historians may become nationally renowned or best-selling authors and may or may not serve the interests of particular political viewpoints in their roles as ?public historians?. Many authors of ?official histories? and ?authorized biographies? would qualify as popular historians serving the interests of particular institutions or public figures.

Recent examples of American popular historians with academic affiliations include [[Stephen Ambrose]], [[Doris Kearns Goodwin]] and [[Pauline Maier]].{{fact|date=January 2012}} Non-academics include [[Bruce Catton]], [[Shelby Foote]] and [[Barbara Tuchman]].{{fact|date=January 2012}}

Recent examples of British popular historians include [[Niall Ferguson]], [[Christopher Hibbert]] and [[Simon Schama]] and ? from a previous generation ? [[E.P. Thompson]], [[A.J.P. Taylor]], and [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]]. {{fact|date=January 2012}}

{{TopicTOC-History}}The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to history:

'''[[History]]''' &amp;ndash; discovery, collection, organization, and presentation of information about past events. History can also mean the period of time after writing was invented.

== Nature of history ==
History can be described as all of the following:

* [[Academic discipline]] &amp;ndash; body of knowledge given to - or received by - a disciple (student); a branch or sphere of knowledge, or field of study, that an individual has chosen to specialise in.
** one of the [[humanities]] &amp;ndash; academic discipline that study the human condition, using methods that are primarily analytical, critical, or speculative, as distinguished from the mainly empirical approaches of the natural sciences.
* [[Fields of science|Field of science]]  &amp;ndash; widely-recognized category of specialized expertise within science, and typically embodies its own terminology and nomenclature.  Such a field will usually be represented by one or more scientific journals, where peer reviewed research is published.  There are many sociology-related scientific journals.
** [[Social science]]  &amp;ndash; field of academic scholarship that explores aspects of human society.

'''History''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|''???????''}} - ''historia'', meaning &quot;inquiry, knowledge acquired by investigation&quot;&lt;ref name=JosephJanda/&gt;) is the discovery, collection, organization, and presentation of information about past events. History can also mean the period of time after writing was invented. Scholars who write about history are called [[historian]]s. It is a field of research which uses a [[narrative]] to examine and analyse the sequence of events, and it sometimes attempts to investigate objectively the patterns of cause and effect that determine events.&lt;ref name=&quot;evans1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.history.ac.uk/ihr/Focus/Whatishistory/evans10.html|title= The Two Faces of E.H.

Amongst scholars, the fifth-century BC Greek historian [[Herodotus]] is considered to be the &quot;father of history&quot;, and, along with his contemporary [[Thucydides]], forms the foundations for the modern study of history. Their influence, along with other historical traditions in other parts of their world, have spawned many different interpretations of the nature of history which has evolved over the centuries and are continuing to change. The modern study of history has many different fields including those that focus on certain regions and those which focus on certain topical or thematical elements of historical investigation. Often history is taught as part of primary and secondary education, and the academic study of history is a major discipline in University studies.

==Etymology==
[[File:History-Dielman-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|''History'' by [[Frederick Dielman]] (1896)]]
A  derivation from ''*weid-'' &quot;know&quot; or &quot;see&quot; is attested as &quot;the reconstructed etymon ''wid-tor'' [&quot;one who knows&quot;] (compare to English ''wit'') a suffixed zero-grade  form of the [[proto-Indo-European root|PIE]] root ''*weid-''-'see' and so is related to Greek ''eid&amp;eacute;nai'', to know &quot;...&lt;ref name=JosephJanda&gt;{{Cite book| last =Joseph | first =Brian (Ed.)| last2 =Janda | first2 =Richard (Ed.)| publication-date =30 December 2004| title =The Handbook of Historical Linguistics| publisher =Blackwell Publishing| page =163| isbn =978-1405127479| year =2008| postscript =&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;etym&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=history |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ancient Greek]] [[polytonic|???????]]&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|i(stori/a|???????}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''h?st?r'') means &quot;inquiry&quot;,&quot;knowledge from inquiry&quot;, or  &quot;judge&quot;. It was in that sense that [[Aristotle]] used the word in his {{polytonic|[[History of Animals|???? ?? ??? ????????]]}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Ferrater-Mora&quot;&gt;Ferrater-Mora, Jos?. ''Diccionario de Filosofia''. Barcelona: Editorial Ariel, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; (''Per? T? Z?a ?istor?ai'' &quot;Inquiries about Animals&quot;). The ancestor word {{polytonic|?????}} is attested early on in [[Homeric Hymns]], [[Heraclitus]], the [[Athens|Athenian]] [[ephebos|ephebe]]s' oath, and in [[Boeotia|Boiotic]] inscriptions (in a legal sense, either &quot;judge&quot; or &quot;witness&quot;, or similar).

The word entered the [[English language]] in 1390 with the meaning of &quot;relation of incidents, story&quot;. In [[Middle English]], the meaning was &quot;story&quot; in general. The restriction to the meaning &quot;record of past events&quot; arises in the late 15th century. It was still in the Greek sense that [[Francis Bacon]] used the term in the late 16th century, when he wrote about &quot;[[Natural history|Natural History]]&quot;. For him, ''historia'' was &quot;the knowledge of objects determined by space and time&quot;, that sort of knowledge provided by [[memory]] (while [[science]] was provided by [[reason]], and [[poetry]] was provided by [[fantasy]]).

In an expression of the linguistic [[Synthetic language|synthetic vs. analytic/isolating dichotomy]], English like Chinese (? vs. ?) now designates separate words for human history and [[storytelling]] in general. In modern German, French, and most Germanic and Romance languages, which are solidly synthetic and highly inflected, the same word is still used to mean both &quot;history&quot; and &quot;story&quot;.

The adjective ''historical'' is attested from 1661, and ''historic'' from 1669.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitney&quot;&gt;Whitney, W. D. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=wrACAAAAIAAJ The Century dictionary; an encyclopedic lexicon of the English language]''. New York: The Century Co, 1889.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Historian'' in the sense of a &quot;researcher of history&quot; is attested from 1531. In all [[European languages]], the substantive &quot;history&quot; is still used to mean both &quot;what happened with men&quot;, and &quot;the scholarly study of the happened&quot;, the latter sense sometimes distinguished with a capital letter, &quot;History&quot;, or the word ''[[historiography]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ferrater-Mora&quot; /&gt;

==Description==
[[File:The Historians' History of the World - Title Page.jpg|thumb|The title page to ''[[The Historians' History of the World]]'']]
Historians write in the context of their own time, and with due regard to the current dominant ideas of how to interpret the past, and sometimes write to provide lessons for their own society. In the words of [[Benedetto Croce]], &quot;All history is contemporary history&quot;. History is facilitated by the formation of a 'true discourse of past' through the production of narrative and analysis of past events relating to the human race.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitney&quot;&gt;Whitney, W. D. (1889). [http://books.google.com/books?id=wrACAAAAIAAJ The Century dictionary; an encyclopedic lexicon of the English language]. New York: The Century Co. Page [http://books.google.com/books?id=wrACAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA2842,M1 2842].&lt;/ref&gt; The modern discipline of history is dedicated to the institutional production of this discourse.

All events that are remembered and preserved in some authentic form constitute the historical record.&lt;ref name=&quot;wordnet&quot;&gt;[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn WordNet Search ? 3.0], &quot;History&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The task of historical discourse is to identify the sources which can most usefully contribute to the production of accurate accounts of past. Therefore, the constitution of the historian's archive is a result of circumscribing a more general archive by invalidating the usage of certain texts and documents (by falsifying their claims to represent the 'true past').

The study of history has sometimes been classified as part of the [[humanities]] and at other times as part of the [[social sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott Gordon and James Gordon Irving, ''The History and Philosophy of Social Science''. Routledge 1991. Page 1. ISBN 0415056829&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be seen as a bridge between those two broad areas, incorporating methodologies from both. Some individual historians strongly support one or the other classification.&lt;ref&gt;Ritter, H. (1986). Dictionary of concepts in history. Reference sources for the social sciences and humanities, no. 3. Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press. Page 416.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, French [[historian]] [[Fernand Braudel]] revolutionized the study of history, by using such outside disciplines as [[economics]], [[anthropology]], and [[geography]] in the study of global history.

Traditionally, historians have recorded events of the past, either in writing or by passing on an [[oral tradition]], and have attempted to answer historical questions through the study of written documents and oral accounts. For the beginning, historians have also used such sources as monuments, inscriptions, and pictures. In general, the sources of historical knowledge can be separated into three categories: what is written, what is said, and what is physically preserved, and historians often consult all three.&lt;ref&gt;Michael C. Lemon (1995).The Discipline of History and the History of Thought. Routledge. Page 201. ISBN 0415123461&lt;/ref&gt; But writing is the marker that separates history from what comes before.

[[Archaeology]] is a discipline that is especially helpful in dealing with buried sites and objects, which, once unearthed, contribute to the study of history. But archaeology rarely stands alone. It uses narrative sources to complement its discoveries. However, archaeology is constituted by a range of methodologies and approaches which are independent from history; that is to say, archaeology does not &quot;fill the gaps&quot; within textual sources. Indeed, Historical Archaeology is a specific branch of archaeology, often contrasting its conclusions against those of contemporary textual sources. For example, Mark Leone, the excavator and interpreter of historical [[Annapolis, Maryland]], USA has sought to understand the contradiction between textual documents and the material record, demonstrating the possession of slaves and the inequalities of wealth apparent via the study of the total historical environment, despite the ideology of &quot;liberty&quot; inherent in written documents at this time.

There are varieties of ways in which history can be organized, including chronologically, [[culture|culturally]], territorially, and thematically. These divisions are not mutually exclusive, and significant overlaps are often present, as in &quot;The International Women's Movement in an Age of Transition, 1830?1975.&quot; It is possible for historians to concern themselves with both the very specific and the very general, although the modern trend has been toward specialization. The area called [[Big History]] resists this specialization, and searches for universal patterns or trends. History has often been studied with some practical or [[theory|theoretical]] aim, but also may be studied out of simple intellectual curiosity.&lt;ref name=&quot;graham-ch1&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Shape of the Past |author=Graham, Gordon |publisher=[[Oxford University]] |year=1997 |chapter=Chapter 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and prehistory==
{{Human history and prehistory|250}}
{{See|Protohistory}}

The [[history of the world]] is the memory of the past [[experience]] of ''[[Homo sapiens sapiens]]'' around the world, as that experience has been preserved, largely in written records. By &quot;prehistory&quot;, historians mean the recovery of knowledge of the past in an area where no written records exist, or where the writing of a culture is not understood. [[Human history]] is marked both by a gradual [[List of discoveries|accretion of discoveries]] and [[Timeline of historic inventions|inventions]], as well as by [[quantum leap]]s?[[paradigm shift]]s, [[revolution]]s?that comprise epochs in the material and spiritual evolution of humankind. By studying painting, drawings, carvings, and other artifacts, some information can be recovered even in the absence of a written record. Since the 20th century, the study of prehistory is considered essential to avoid history's implicit exclusion of certain civilizations, such as those of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and [[pre-Columbian]] America. Historians in the West have been criticized for focusing disproportionately on the [[Western world]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Goody]] (2007) ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=jo1UVi48KywC&amp;pg=RA2-PA1930&amp;dq=Jack+Goody+2007&amp;sig=g0N7ZF9nz_Uy8nrQTiGdsc0N3sI#PPA12,M1 The Theft of History]'' (from [[Google Books]])&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, British historian [[E. H. Carr]] wrote:
{{quote|The line of demarcation between prehistoric and historical times is crossed when people cease to live only in the present, and become consciously interested both in their past and in their future. History begins with the handing down of tradition; and tradition means the carrying of the habits and lessons of the past into the future. Records of the past begin to be kept for the benefit of future generations.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, Edward H. (1961). ''What is History?'', p.108, ISBN 0140206523&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This definition includes within the scope of history the strong interests of peoples, such as [[Australian Aboriginals]] and New Zealand [[M?ori people|M?ori]] in the past, and the oral records maintained and transmitted to succeeding generations, even before their contact with European civilization.

==Historiography==
{{Main|Historiography}}
Historiography has a number of related meanings. Firstly, it can refer to how history has been produced: the story of the development of [[Historical method|methodology]] and practices (for example, the move from short-term biographical narrative towards long-term thematic analysis). Secondly, it can refer to what has been produced: a specific body of historical writing (for example, &quot;medieval historiography during the 1960s&quot; means &quot;Works of medieval history written during the 1960s&quot;). Thirdly, it may refer to why history is produced: the [[Philosophy of history]]. As a [[meta-level]] analysis of descriptions of the past, this third conception can relate to the first two in that the analysis usually focuses on the narratives, [[Language interpretation|interpretation]]s, [[worldview]], use of [[evidence]], or method of presentation of other [[historian]]s. Professional historians also debate the question of whether history can be taught as a single coherent narrative or a series of competing narratives.

* What is the proper unit for the study of the human past?the individual? The polis? The civilization? The culture? Or the nation state?
* Are there broad patterns and progress? Are there cycles? Is human history random and devoid of any meaning?
|}

{{Main|Philosophy of history}}
Philosophy of history is a branch of philosophy concerning the eventual significance, if any, of human history. Furthermore, it speculates as to a possible teleological end to its development?that is, it asks if there is a design, purpose, directive principle, or finality in the processes of human history. Philosophy of history should not be confused with historiography, which is the study of history as an academic discipline, and thus concerns its methods and practices, and its development as a discipline over time. Nor should philosophy of history be confused with the [[history of philosophy]], which is the study of the development of philosophical ideas through time.

&lt;div style=&quot;background:#f8eaba; text-align:center;&quot;&gt; Historical method basics &lt;/div&gt;

The following questions are used by historians in modern work.
# ''When was'' the source, written or unwritten, produced ([[Calendar date|date]])?
# Where was it produced ([[Internationalization and localization|localization]])?
# By whom was it produced ([[authorship]])?
# From what pre-existing material was it produced ([[wikt:analysis|analysis]])?
# In what original form was it produced ([[integrity]])?
# What is the evidential value of its contents ([[credibility]])?
The first four are known as [[higher criticism]]; the fifth, [[lower criticism]]; and, together, external criticism. ''The sixth and final inquiry'' about a source is called internal criticism.

The historical method comprises the techniques and guidelines by which [[historian]]s use [[primary source]]s and other evidence to research and then to [[historiography|write history]].

[[Herodotus]] of [[Halicarnassus]] (484 BC ? ca.425 BC)&lt;ref name=&quot;lamberg-karlovsky-p5&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Ancient Civilizations: The Near East and Mesoamerica |author=Lamberg-Karlovsky, C. C. and Jeremy A. Sabloff |publisher=Benjamin-Cummings Publishing |year=1979 |page=5|isbn=0881338346}}&lt;/ref&gt; has generally been acclaimed as the &quot;father of history&quot;. However, his contemporary [[Thucydides]] (ca. 460 BC ? ca. 400 BC) is credited with having first approached history with a well-developed historical method in his work the [[History of the Peloponnesian War]]. Thucydides, unlike Herodotus, regarded history as being the product of the choices and actions of human beings, and looked at cause and effect, rather than as the result of divine intervention.&lt;ref name=&quot;lamberg-karlovsky-p5&quot;/&gt; In his historical method, Thucydides emphasized chronology, a neutral point of view, and that the human world was the result of the actions of human beings. Greek historians also viewed history as [[Historic recurrence|cyclical]], with events regularly recurring.&lt;ref name=&quot;lamberg-karlovsky-p6&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Ancient Civilizations: The Near East and Mesoamerica |author=Lamberg-Karlovsky, C. C. and Jeremy A. Sabloff |publisher=Benjamin-Cummings Publishing |year=1979 |page=6|isbn=0881338346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were historical traditions and sophisticated use of historical method in ancient and medieval [[China]]. The groundwork for professional historiography in [[East Asia]] was established by the [[Han Dynasty]] court historian known as [[Sima Qian]] (145?90 BC), author of the ''[[Shiji]]'' ([[Records of the Grand Historian]]). For the quality of his timeless written work, Sima Qian is posthumously known as the Father of [[Chinese Historiography]]. Chinese historians of subsequent dynastic periods in China used his ''Shiji'' as the official format for [[Twenty-Four Histories|historical texts]], as well as for biographical literature.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

[[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] was influential in [[Western Christianity|Christian]] and [[Western thought]] at the beginning of the medieval period. Through the Medieval and [[Renaissance]] periods, history was often studied through a [[sacred history|sacred]] or religious perspective. Around 1800, German philosopher and historian [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] brought [[philosophy]] and a more [[secular]] approach in historical study.&lt;ref name=&quot;graham-ch1&quot;/&gt;

In the preface to his book, the ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' (1377), the [[Historiography of early Islam|Arab historian]] and [[Sociology in medieval Islam|early sociologist]], [[Ibn Khaldun]], warned of seven mistakes that he thought that historians regularly committed. In this criticism, he approached the past as strange and in need of interpretation. The originality of Ibn Khaldun was to claim that the cultural difference of another age must govern the evaluation of relevant historical material, to distinguish the principles according to which it might be possible to attempt the evaluation, and lastly, to feel the need for experience, in addition to rational principles, in order to assess a culture of the past. Ibn Khaldun often criticized &quot;idle [[superstition]] and uncritical acceptance of historical data.&quot; As a result, he introduced a [[scientific method]] to the study of history, and he often referred to it as his &quot;new science&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Khaldun]], Franz Rosenthal, N. J. Dawood (1967), ''The Muqaddimah: An Introduction to History'', p. x, [[Princeton University Press]], ISBN 0691017549.&lt;/ref&gt; His historical method also laid the groundwork for the observation of the role of [[State (polity)|state]], [[communication]], [[propaganda]] and [[systematic bias]] in history,&lt;ref name=Mowlana&gt;H. Mowlana (2001). &quot;Information in the Arab World&quot;, ''Cooperation South Journal'' '''1'''.&lt;/ref&gt; and he is thus considered to be the &quot;father of historiography&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Salahuddin Ahmed (1999).

In the West historians developed modern methods of historiography in the 17th and 18th centuries, especially in France and Germany. The 19th-century historian with greatest influence on methods was [[Leopold von Ranke]] in Germany.

In the 20th century, academic historians focused less on epic nationalistic narratives, which often tended to glorify the nation or individuals, to more objective and complex analyses of social and intellectual forces. A major trend of historical methodology in the 20th century was a tendency to treat history more as a [[social science]] rather than as an [[art]], which traditionally had been the case. Some of the leading advocates of history as a social science were a diverse collection of scholars which included [[Fernand Braudel]], [[E. H. Carr]], [[Fritz Fischer]], [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]], [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]], [[Bruce Trigger]], [[Marc Bloch]], [[Karl Dietrich Bracher]], [[Peter Gay]], [[Robert Fogel]], [[Lucien Febvre]] and [[Lawrence Stone]]. Many of the advocates of history as a social science were or are noted for their multi-disciplinary approach. Braudel combined history with geography, Bracher history with political science, Fogel history with economics, Gay history with psychology, Trigger history with archaeology while Wehler, Bloch, Fischer, Stone, Febvre and Le Roy Ladurie have in varying and differing ways amalgamated history with sociology, geography, anthropology, and economics. More recently, the field of [[digital history]] has begun to address ways of using computer technology to pose new questions to historical data and generate digital scholarship.

In opposition to the claims of history as a social science, historians such as [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]], [[John Lukacs]], [[Donald Creighton]], [[Gertrude Himmelfarb]] and [[Gerhard Ritter]] argued that the key to the historians' work was the power of the [[imagination]], and hence contended that history should be understood as an art. French historians associated with the [[Annales School]] introduced quantitative history, using raw data to track the lives of typical individuals, and were prominent in the establishment of [[cultural history]] (cf. ''[[histoire des mentalit?s]]''). Intellectual historians such as [[Herbert Butterfield]], [[Ernst Nolte]] and [[George Mosse]] have argued for the significance of ideas in history. American historians, motivated by the civil rights era, focused on formerly overlooked ethnic, racial, and socio-economic groups. Another genre of [[social history]] to emerge in the post-WWII era was ''[[Alltagsgeschichte]]'' (History of Everyday Life). Scholars such as [[Martin Broszat]], [[Ian Kershaw]] and [[Detlev Peukert]] sought to examine what everyday life was like for ordinary people in 20th-century Germany, especially in the [[Nazi]] period.

[[Marxist historiography|Marxist historians]] such as [[Eric Hobsbawm]], [[E. P. Thompson]], [[Rodney Hilton]], [[Georges Lefebvre]], [[Eugene D. Genovese]], [[Isaac Deutscher]], [[C. L. R. James]], [[Timothy Mason]], [[Herbert Aptheker]], [[Arno J. Mayer]] and [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] have sought to validate [[Karl Marx]]'s theories by analyzing history from a Marxist perspective. In response to the Marxist interpretation of history, historians such as [[Fran?ois Furet]], [[Richard Pipes]], [[J. C. D. Clark]], [[Roland Mousnier]], [[Henry Ashby Turner]] and [[Robert Conquest]] have offered anti-Marxist interpretations of history. [[Feminism|Feminist]] historians such as [[Joan Wallach Scott]], [[Claudia Koonz]], [[Natalie Zemon Davis]], [[Sheila Rowbotham]], [[Gisela Bock]], [[Gerda Lerner]], [[Elizabeth Fox-Genovese]], and [[Lynn Hunt]] have argued for the importance of studying the experience of women in the past. In recent years, [[postmodernism|postmodernists]] have challenged the validity and need for the study of history on the basis that all history is based on the personal interpretation of sources. In his 1997 book ''In Defence of History'', [[Richard J. Evans]], a professor of modern history at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], defended the worth of history. Another defence of history from post-modernist criticism was the Australian historian [[Keith Windschuttle]]'s 1994 book, ''The Killing of History''.

==Historians==
{{Main|List of historians}}

Professional and amateur historians discover, collect, organize, and present information about past events. In [[list of historians|lists of historians]], historians can be grouped by order of the historical period in which they were writing, which is not necessarily the same as the period in which they specialized. Chroniclers and annalists, though they are not historians in the true sense, are also frequently included.

===Periods===
{{Main|Periodization}}
Historical study often focuses on events and developments that occur in particular blocks of time. Historians give these [[Periodization|periods of time]] names in order to allow &quot;organising ideas and classificatory generalisations&quot; to be used by historians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marwick-p169&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Nature of History |author=Marwick, Arthur|publisher=The Macmillian Press LTD |year=1970 |page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; The names given to a period can vary with geographical location, as can the dates of the start and end of a particular period. [[Centuries]] and [[decade]]s are commonly used periods and the time they represent depends on the [[Calendar era|dating system]] used. Most periods are constructed retrospectively and so reflect value judgments made about the past. The way periods are constructed and the names given to them can affect the way they are viewed and studied.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tosh-p168-169&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Pursuit of History|author=Tosh, John|publisher=Pearson Education Limited|year=2006 |pages=168?169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geographical locations===
Particular [[geographical]] locations can form the basis of historical study, for example, [[continent]]s, [[countries]] and [[cities]]. Understanding why historic events took place is important. To do this, historians often turn to [[geography]]. Weather patterns, the water supply, and the landscape of a place all affect the lives of the people who live there. For example, to explain why the ancient Egyptians developed a successful civilization, studying the [[geography of Egypt]] is essential. Egyptian civilization was built on the banks of the Nile River, which flooded each year, depositing soil on its banks. The rich soil could help farmers grow enough crops to feed the people in the cities. That meant everyone did not have to farm, so some people could perform other jobs that helped develop the civilization.

====World====
{{Main|History of the world}}
World history is the study of major civilizations over the last 3000 years or so. It has led to highly controversial interpretations by [[Oswald Spengler]] and [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], among others. World history is especially important as a teaching field. It has increasingly entered the university curriculum in the U.S., in many cases replacing courses in Western Civilization, that had a focus on Europe and the U.S. World history adds extensive new material on Asia, Africa and Latin America.

====Regions====
* [[History of Africa]] begins with the first emergence of modern human beings on the continent, continuing into its modern present as a patchwork of diverse and politically developing nation states.
* [[History of the Americas]] is the collective history of North and South America, including Central America and the Caribbean.
** [[History of North America]] is the study of the past passed down from generation to generation on the continent in the Earth's northern and western hemisphere.
** [[History of Central America]] is the study of the past passed down from generation to generation on the continent in the Earth's western hemisphere.
** [[History of the Caribbean]] begins with the oldest evidence where 7,000-year-old remains have been found.
** [[History of South America]] is the study of the past passed down from generation to generation on the continent in the Earth's southern and western hemisphere.
* [[History of Antarctica]] emerges from early Western theories of a vast continent, known as Terra Australis, believed to exist in the far south of the globe.
* [[History of Australia]] start with the documentation of the Makassar trading with Indigenous Australians on Australia's north coast.
* [[History of New Zealand]] dates back at least 700 years to when it was discovered and settled by Polynesians, who developed a distinct M?ori culture centred on kinship links and land.
* [[History of the Pacific Islands]] covers the history of the islands in the Pacific Ocean.
* [[History of Eurasia]] is the collective history of several distinct peripheral coastal regions: the Middle East, South Asia, East Asia, Southeast Asia, and Europe, linked by the interior mass of the Eurasian steppe of Central Asia and Eastern Europe.
** [[History of Europe]] describes the passage of time from humans inhabiting the European continent to the present day.
** [[History of Asia]] can be seen as the collective history of several distinct peripheral coastal regions, East Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East linked by the interior mass of the Eurasian steppe.
*** [[History of East Asia]] is the study of the past passed down from generation to generation in East Asia.
*** [[History of the Middle East]] begins with the earliest civilizations in the region now known as the Middle East that were established around 3000 BC, in Mesopotamia (Iraq).
*** [[History of South Asia]] is the study of the past passed down from generation to generation in the Sub-Himalayan region.
*** [[History of Southeast Asia]] has been characterized as interaction between regional players and foreign powers.

===Military history===
{{Main|Military history}}

[[Military history]] concerns warfare, strategies, battles, weapons, and the psychology of combat.  The &quot;new military history&quot; since the 1970s has been concerned with soldiers more than generals, with psychology more than tactics, and with the broader impact of warfare on society and culture.&lt;ref name=Pavkovic&gt;{{Cite book | last =Pavkovic

===History of religion===
The history of religion has been a main theme for both secular and religious historians for centuries, and continues to be taught in seminaries and academe. Leading journals include Church History,  [[Catholic Historical Review]], and ''History of Religions''. Topics range widely from political and cultural and artistic dimensions, to theology and liturgy.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Cochrane, &quot;What Is Catholic Historiography?&quot; ''Catholic Historical Review'' Vol. 61, No. 2 (Apr., 1975), pp. 169-190 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/25019673 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  Every major country is covered,&lt;ref&gt;For example see Sofia Boesch Gajano and Tommaso Cali?, &quot;Italian religious historiography in the 1990s,&quot; ''Journal of Modern Italian Studies,'' Fall 1998, Vol. 3 Issue 3, pp 293-306&lt;/ref&gt; and most smaller ones as well.

===Social history===
{{Main|Social history}}
''Social history'', sometimes called the ''new social history,'' is the field that includes history of ordinary people and their strategies and institutions for coping with life.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Stearns, ed. ''Encyclopedia of Social History'' (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; In its &quot;golden age&quot; it was a major growth field in the 1960s and 1970s among scholars, and still is well represented in history departments. In two decades from 1975 to 1995, the proportion of professors of history in American universities identifying with social history rose from 31% to 41%, while the proportion of political historians fell from 40% to 30%.&lt;ref&gt;Diplomatic dropped from 5% to 3%, economic history from 7% to 5%, and cultural history grew from 14% to 16%.  Based on full-time professors in U.S. history departments. Stephen H. Haber, David M. Kennedy, and Stephen D. Krasner, &quot;Brothers under the Skin: Diplomatic History and International Relations,&quot; ''International Security,'' Vol. 22, No. 1 (Summer, 1997), pp. 34-43 at p. 4 2; [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2539326 online at JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the history departments of British universities in 2007, of the 5723 faculty members, 1644 (29%)  identified themselves with '''social history''' while [[political history]] came next with 1425 (25%).&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.history.ac.uk/ihr/Resources/Teachers/a27.html &quot;Teachers of History in the Universities of the UK 2007 - listed by research interest&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;
The &quot;old&quot; social history before the 1960s was a hodgepodge of topics without a central theme, and it often included political movements, like Populism, that were &quot;social&quot; in the sense of being outside the elite system. Social history was contrasted with [[political history]], [[intellectual history]] and the history of [[Great man theory|great men]]. English historian [[G. M. Trevelyan]] saw it as the bridging point between economic and political history, reflecting that, &quot;Without social history, economic history is barren and political history unintelligible.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=English Social History: A Survey of Six Centuries from Chaucer to Queen Victoria|author=[[G. M. Trevelyan]]|publisher=Book Club Associates|year=1973|chapter=Introduction|page=i|isbn=058248488X}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the field has often been viewed negatively as history with the politics left out, it has also been defended as &quot;history with the people put back in.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The People's State: East German Society from Hitler to Honecker|author=Mary Fulbrook|location=London|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|year=2005|chapter=Introduction: The people's paradox|page=17|isbn=9780300144246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural history===
{{Main|Cultural history}}
Cultural history replaced [[social history]] as the dominant form in the 1980s and 1990s. It typically combines the approaches of anthropology and history to look at language, popular cultural traditions and cultural interpretations of historical experience. It examines the records and narrative descriptions of past knowledge, customs, and arts of a group of people. How peoples constructed their memory of the past is a major topic.

===Diplomatic history===
{{Main|Diplomatic history}}
[[Diplomatic history]], sometimes referred to as &quot;''Rankian History''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Burke, P. (1998). New perspectives on historical writing. University Park, Pa: [[Pennsylvania State University Press]]. Page 3.&lt;/ref&gt; in honor of [[Leopold von Ranke]], focuses on [[politics]], politicians and other high rulers and views them as being the driving force of continuity and change in history. This type of ''political history'' is the study of the conduct of [[International relations#History|international relations]] between states or across state boundaries over time. This is the most common form of history and is often the classical and popular belief of what history should be.

===Economic history===
{{main|Economic history}}
Although economic history has been well established since the late 19th century, in recent years academic studies have shifted more and more toward economics departments and away from traditional history departments.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Whaples, &quot;Is Economic History a Neglected Field of Study?,&quot; Historically Speaking (April 2010) v. 11#2 pp 17-20, with responses pp 20-27&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental history===
{{main|Environmental history}}
Environmental history is a new field that emerged in the 1980s to look at the history of the environment, especially in the long run, and the impact of human activities upon it.&lt;ref&gt;J. D. Hughes, ''What is Environmental History'' (2006) [http://www.amazon.com/What-Environmental-History/dp/0745631886/  excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;

===World history===
{{main|World History}}
World history is primarily a teaching field, rather than a research field.  It gained popularity in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;Ainslie T. Embree and Carol Gluck, eds., ''Asia in Western and World History: A Guide for Teaching''  (M.E. Sharpe, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Japan&lt;ref&gt;Shigeru Akita, &quot;World History and the Emergence of Global History in Japan,&quot;''Chinese Studies in History,'' Spring 2010, Vol. 43 Issue 3, pp 84-96&lt;/ref&gt; and other countries after the 1980s with the realization that students need a broader exposure to the world as globalization proceeds.

The World History Association publishes the ''Journal of World History'' every quarter since 1990.&lt;ref&gt;see [http://www.historycooperative.org/jwhindex.html JWH Website]&lt;/ref&gt; The H-World discussion list&lt;ref&gt;see [http://www.h-net.org/~world/ H-World]&lt;/ref&gt; serves as a network of communication among practitioners of world history, with discussions among scholars, announcements, syllabi, bibliographies and book reviews.

===People's history===
{{Main|People's history}}
A [[people's history]] is a type of historical work which attempts to account for historical events from the [[Populism|perspective of common people]]. A people's history is the history of the world that is the story of mass movements and of the outsiders. Individuals or groups not included in the past in other type of writing about history are the primary focus, which includes the [[Disfranchisement|disenfranchised]], the [[oppression|oppressed]], the [[poverty|poor]], the [[Nonconformism|nonconformists]], and the otherwise  forgotten people. This history also usually focuses on events occurring in the fullness of time, or when an overwhelming wave of smaller events cause certain developments to occur.

===Historiometry===
{{Main|Historiometry }}
[[Historiometry]] is a historical study of human progress or individual personal characteristics, by using statistics to analyze references to eminent persons, their statements, behavior and discoveries in relatively neutral texts.

===Gender history===
{{Main|Gender history}}
[[Gender history]] is a sub-field of History and [[Gender studies]], which looks at the past from the perspective of [[gender]]. It is in many ways, an outgrowth of [[women's history]]. Despite its relatively short life, Gender History (and its forerunner Women's History) has had a rather significant effect on the general study of history. Since the 1960s, when the initially small field first achieved a measure of acceptance, it has gone through a number of different phases, each with its own challenges and outcomes. Although some of the changes to the study of history have been quite obvious, such as increased numbers of books on famous women or simply the admission of greater numbers of women into the historical profession, other influences are more subtle.

===Public history===
{{Main|Public history}}
[[Public history]] is a term that describes the broad range of activities undertaken by people with some training in the discipline of history who are generally working outside of specialized academic settings. Public history practice has quite deep roots in the areas of historic preservation, archival science, oral history, museum curatorship, and other related fields. The term itself began to be used in the U.S. and Canada in the late 1970s, and the field has become increasingly professionalized since that time. Some of the most common settings for public history are museums, historic homes and historic sites, parks, battlefields, archives, film and television companies, and all levels of government.

==Pseudohistory==
{{Main|Pseudohistory}}

''[[Pseudohistory]]'' is a term applied to texts which purport to be historical in nature but which depart from standard [[Historical method|historiographical conventions]] in a way which undermines their conclusions.
Closely related to deceptive [[historical revisionism (negationism)|historical revisionsm]], works which draw controversial conclusions from new, speculative, or disputed historical evidence, particularly in the fields of national, political, military, and religious affairs, are often rejected as pseudohistory.

==Teaching history ==
From the origins of national school systems in the 19th century, the teaching of history to promote national sentiment has been a high priority.  In the United States after World War I, a strong movement emerged at the university level to teach courses in Western Civilization, so as to give students a common heritage with Europe. In the U.S. after 1980 attention increasingly moved toward teaching [[world history]] or requiring students to take courses in non-western cultures, to prepare students for life in a globalized economy.&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline Swansinger, &quot;Preparing Student Teachers for a World History Curriculum in New York,&quot; ''History Teacher,'' (Nov 2009), 43#1 pp 87-96&lt;/ref&gt;

At the university level, historians debate the question of whether history belongs more to social science or to the humanities. Many view the field from both perspectives.

The teaching of history in French schools was influenced by the [[Nouvelle histoire]] as disseminated after the 1960s by ''Cahiers p?dagogiques and Enseignement'' and other journals for teachers. Also influential was the Institut national de recherche et de documentation p?dagogique, (INRDP).  Joseph Leif, the Inspector-general of teacher training, said pupils children should learn about historians? approaches as well as facts and dates. Louis Fran?ois, Dean of the History/Geography group in the Inspectorate of National Education advised that teachers should provide historic documents and promote &quot;active methods&quot; which would give pupils &quot;the immense happiness of discovery.&quot; Proponents said it was a reaction against the memorization of names and dates that characterized teaching and left the students bored. Traditionalists protested loudly it was a postmodern innovation that threatened to leave the youth ignorant of French patriotism and national identity.&lt;ref&gt;Abby Waldman, &quot; The Politics of History Teaching in England and France during the 1980s,&quot; ''History Workshop Journal''  Issue 68, Autumn 2009 pp. 199-221  [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/history_workshop_journal/v068/68.waldman.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political correctness===
{{details|political historical revisionism}}
In most countries history textbook are tools to foster nationalism and patriotism, and give students the official line about national enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Nicholls, ed. ''School History Textbooks across Cultures: International Debates and Perspectives'' (2006) &lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries history textbooks are sponsored by the national government and are written to put the national heritage in the most favorable light. For example, in Japan, mention of the [[Nanking Massacre]] has been removed from textbooks and the entire World War II is given cursory treatment. Other countries have complained.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Schneider, &quot;The Japanese History Textbook Controversy in East Asian Perspective,&quot; ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,'' May 2008, Vol. 617, pp 107-122&lt;/ref&gt; It was standard policy in communist countries to present only a rigid Marxist historiography.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Problems of Teaching Contemporary Russian History,&quot; ''Russian Studies in History,'' Winter 2004, Vol. 43 Issue 3, pp 61-62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1468-2346.2008.00708.x?cookieSet=1 |title=Blackwell-Synergy.com |publisher=Blackwell-Synergy.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States the history of the [[American Civil War]] was phrased to avoid giving offense to white Southerners and blacks.&lt;ref&gt;James W. Loewen, ''Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong'', (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic historians have often fought against the politicization of the textbooks, sometimes with success.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Teaching History in Schools: the Politics of Textbooks in India,&quot; ''History Workshop Journal,'' April 2009, Issue 67, pp 99-110&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tatyana Volodina, &quot;Teaching History in Russia After the Collapse of the USSR,&quot; ''History Teacher,'' Feb 2005, Vol. 38 Issue 2, pp 179-188&lt;/ref&gt;

In 21st-century Germany, the history curriculum is controlled by the 16 states, and is characterized not by superpatriotism but rather by an &quot;almost pacifistic and deliberately unpatriotic undertone&quot; and reflects &quot;principles formulated by international organizations such as UNESCO or the Council of Europe, thus oriented towards human rights, democracy and peace.&quot;  The result is that &quot;German textbooks usually downplay national pride and ambitions and aim to develop an understanding of citizenship centred on democracy, progress, human rights, peace, tolerance and Europeanness.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Simone L?ssig and Karl Heinrich Pohl, &quot;History Textbooks and Historical Scholarship in Germany,&quot; ''History Workshop Journal'' Issue 67, Spring 2009 pp 128-9 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/history_workshop_journal/v067/67.lassig.html online at project MUSE]&lt;/ref&gt;

==By ideological classification (historiography)==
Although there is arguably some intrinsic [[bias]] in history studies (with [[nationalism|national]] bias perhaps being the most significant), history can also be studied from [[ideology|ideological]] perspectives, which practitioners feel are often ignored, such as:
*[[Marxist historiography]]
*[[Feminist history]] (also called ''herstory'').

A form of historical speculation known commonly as [[counterfactual history]] has also been adopted by some historians as a means of assessing and exploring the possible outcomes if certain events had not occurred or had occurred in a different way. This is somewhat similar to the [[Alternate history (fiction)|alternate history]] genre in fiction.

Lists of false or dubious historical resources and [[historical myths]] that were once popular and widespread, or have becomes so, have also been prepared.

{{Unreferenced stub|auto=yes|date=December 2009}}There are many '''Schools of History''', each reflecting different [[historiography|historiographical]] approaches to the subject.
Note that a &quot;School&quot; of [[History]] is neither a physical structure nor an educational establishment, but is a term applied to a group of like-minded academics.

Historians may or may not &quot;officially&quot; subscribe to one or more schools. They may also lean toward one, or, over the course of a career, change their stance.

Some schools have become largely defunct, due to being discredited.

==Schools based on differing philosophies==
*[[Annales School]]
*[[Marxist historiography]]
*[[Whig history]]

==Schools focusing on history through another discipline==
*[[Historical school of economics]]
*[[German Historical School]] (law)

* '''[[Archive]]''' - A collection of documents and records
* '''[[Cultural artifact|Artifact]]''' - A material object of a culture such as a tool, an article of clothing or a prepared food
* '''[[Audience]]''' ? A class of entity for whom the resource is intended or useful
* '''[[Autobiography]]''' - An individual's account of their life
* '''[[Auxiliary sciences of history]]''' - A set of specialist scholarly disciplines which help evaluate and use historical sources, and which may be used to support historical research.
* '''[[Available]]''' ? Date (often a range) that the resource became or will become available
* '''[[Avalonia]]''' - A separate plate in the Early Paleozoic consisting of much of Northern Europe, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and some coastal parts of New England

&lt;/div&gt;

== B ==
&lt;div style=&quot;-moz-column-count: 2; column-count: 2;&quot;&gt;

* '''[[Baltica]]''' - A separate continental plate of the Early Paleozoic composed of the United Kingdom, Scandinavia, European Russia and Central Europe; named for the Baltic Sea
* '''[[Barbarian]]''' - A Greek word adopted by the Romans to refer to any people who did not adopt the Roman way of life. It is said to have come originally from the sound bar-bar, which, according to the Greeks, was supposed to be the noise that people made when speaking foreign languages
* '''[[Bering Land Bridge]]''' - The vast tundra plain that was exposed between Asia and North America during the Last Glacial Maximum, about 21,000 years ago; it served as a migration route for people, animals, and plants. Also known as [[Beringia]]

* '''[[Blitzkrieg]]''' - German for 'lightning war'. A military strategy used by the Germans at the beginning of World War II to achieve victory through a series of quick offensives, especially in Belgium, Holland and France. After an initial bombardment, armour and motorised infantry were mobilised rapidly to break the weakest parts of the enemy line
* '''[[Bolsheviks]]''' - Having split from the Russian Socialist movement in 1903, the Bolsheviks ('Majority') developed into a small, tightly organised, revolutionary Marxist group led by Lenin, for whom violence was a legitimate instrument of power. In November 1917, they took control of a chaotic Russia, becoming the de facto rulers after the subsequent civil war. They then renamed themselves the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU)
* '''[[Book Review]]''' - A critical examination of a text, usually including a summary of the work and opposing views
* '''[[Bourgeoisie]]''' - The capitalist class (see capitalism below) that came to be known as the middle class, between the aristocracy and the working class. A new middle class of merchants and businessmen prospered throughout Europe from the 16th century, and especially in Britain, which Napoleon described as a 'nation of shopkeepers'. The term 'bourgeois' is used derogatorily to describe anything considered humdrum, unimaginative and/or selfishly materialistic
* '''[[Bronze Age]]''' - In Britain, this was the period ? from about 2300 to 700 BC ? when metal first began to be widely used, possibly as a result of the increase in contact with Europe. However, various types of stone, particularly flint, remained very important for long after metal became available. The Bronze Age saw the introduction of cremation of the dead and burials in round barrows. The later (and best known) phases of construction at Stonehenge also date from this period

When the Roman leader Gaius Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC, his nephew and successor Augustus had himself formally adopted by the dead man and so also adopted the family name Caesar. Tiberius and Caligula inherited it by adoption as well. Later Roman emperors acquired the name upon their succession or when they were formally adopted as heirs
* '''[[Cathaysian Terranes]]''' - A set of small landmasses that developed in tropical to subtropical latitudes on the eastern side of Pangea during the Permian and Triassic, includes modern North China (Sino-Korea), South China (Yangtze), Eastern Qiangtang, Tarim, and Indochina.
* '''[[Cimmerian Terranes]]''' - An archipelago of small landmasses that developed in tropical and subtropical latitudes on the eastern side of Pangea during the Triassic, blocks that comprised it include modern Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, Tibet, and Malaysia; also called [[Cimmeria]]

* '''[[Western Interior Seaway|Cretaceous Western Interior Seaway]]''' - The epicontinental sea that formed as marine waters from the north spread over North America from around 130 to 70 million years ago (Ma), at its peak in the Middle Cretaceous (~ 90 Ma) it extended from present-day Utah to the Appalachians and from the Arctic to the Gulf of Mexico; also referred to as the [[Western Interior Seaway]]
&lt;/div&gt;

'''Recorded history''' is the period in [[history of the world]] after [[prehistory]]. It has been written down using [[language]], or recorded using other means of communication. It starts around the [[4th millennium BC]], with the [[Invention of writing|invention]] of [[writing]].

==Historical accounts==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}
Recorded history begins with the accounts of the ancient world by antiquity's own historians. The earliest [[Chronology|chronologies]] date back to [[Mesopotamia]] ([[Sumer]]) and [[ancient Egypt]] ([[Early Dynastic Period of Egypt|Early Dynastic]]). Some of the more notable ancient historians include: [[Josephus Flavius]], [[Herodotus]], [[Thucydides]], [[Polybius]], [[Manetho]] ([[Greek historiography]]), [[Zuo Qiuming]], [[Sima Qian]] ([[Chinese historiography]]), [[Livy]], [[Sallust]], [[Plutarch]], [[Tacitus]], [[Suetonius]] ([[Roman historiography]]).  Although valuable, these accounts can be biased, and should be used with caution.

In pre-modern societies, [[epic poetry]], [[mythography]], collections of legends, and religious texts  were often treated as sources of historical information, and so one may see references to such writers as [[Homer]], [[Vyasa]], [[Valmiki]] and to such works as the biblical [[Book of Exodus]] as historical sources.

Intellectual history

''Note: this article concerns the discipline of intellectual history, and not its object, the whole span of human thought since the [[invention of writing]]. For clarifications about the [[global intellectual history|latter topic]], please consult the writings of the [[Intellectual_history#Prominent_Individuals|intellectual historians listed here]] and entries on individual thinkers.'''''Intellectual history''' refers to the [[history]] of human thoughts in [[writing|written form]] {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}. This history cannot be considered without the knowledge of the men and women who created, discussed, wrote about and in other ways were concerned with [[idea]]s. ''Intellectual history'' is closely related to the [[history of philosophy]] and the [[history of ideas]]. Its central premise is that ideas do not develop in isolation from the people who create and use them and that one must study [[idea]]s not as abstract propositions but in terms of the [[culture]], lives and historical contexts that produced them.

''Intellectual history'' aims to understand ideas from the past by understanding them in context. The term 'context' in the preceding sentence is ambiguous: it can be political, cultural, intellectual and social. One can read a text both in terms of a chronological context (for example, as a contribution to a discipline or tradition as it extended over time) or in terms of a contemporary intellectual moment (for example, as participating in a debate particular to a certain time and place). Both of these acts of contextualization are typical of what intellectual historians do, nor are they exclusive. Generally speaking, intellectual historians seek to place concepts and texts from the past in multiple contexts.

It is important to realize that ''intellectual history'' is not just the history of intellectuals. It studies ideas as they are expressed in texts, and as such is different from other forms of [[cultural history]] which deal also with visual and other non-verbal forms of evidence. Any written trace from the past can be the object of intellectual history. The concept of the [[intellectual]] is relatively recent, and suggests someone professionally concerned with thought. Instead, anyone who has put pen to paper to explore her thoughts can be the object of intellectual history. A famous example of an intellectual history of a non-canonical thinker is [[Carlo Ginzburg]]'s study of a 16th-century Italian miller, Menocchio, in his seminal work ''[[The Cheese and the Worms]]''.

Although the field emerged from European disciplines of [[Kulturgeschichte]] and [[Geistesgeschichte]], the historical study of ideas has engaged not only western intellectual traditions, but others as well including, but not limited to, those in the [[Far East]], [[Near East]] and [[Africa]]. Increasingly, historians are calling for a [[global intellectual history]] that will show the parallels and interrelations in the history of thought of all human societies. Another important trend has been the [[history of the book]] and of [[Reading (process)|reading]], which has drawn attention to the material aspects of how books were designed, produced, distributed and read.

==Intellectual historiography==
Intellectual history as a self-conscious discipline is a relatively recent phenomenon. It has precedents, however, in the [[history of philosophy]], the [[history of ideas]], and in [[cultural history]] as practiced since [[Jacob Burckhardt|Burckhardt]] or indeed since [[Voltaire]]. The history of the human mind, as it was called in the eighteenth century, was of great concern to scholars and philosophers, and their efforts can in part be traced to [[Francis Bacon]]?s call for what he termed a literary history in his [[The Advancement of Learning]]. However, the discipline of intellectual history as it is now understood emerged only in the immediate postwar period, in its earlier incarnation as ?the [[history of ideas]]? under the leadership of [[Arthur Lovejoy]], the founder of the [[Journal of the History of Ideas]]. Since that time, [[Lovejoy]]?s formulation of ?unit-ideas? has been discredited and replaced by more nuanced and more historically sensitive accounts of intellectual activity, and this shift is reflected in the replacement of the phrase [[history of ideas]] by ''intellectual history''.

In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[history of political thought]] has been a particular focus since the late 1960s and is associated especially with the Faculty of History at the [[University of Cambridge]], where until recently such scholars as [[John Dunn (political theorist)|John Dunn]] and [[Quentin Skinner]] studied European political thought in its historical context, emphasizing the emergence and development of such concepts as the state and freedom. [[Quentin Skinner|Skinner]] in particular is renowned for his provocative methodological essays, which were and are widely read by philosophers and practitioners of other humanistic disciplines, and did much to give prominence to the practice of intellectual history. The [[University of Sussex]] in the UK has also achieved a reputation in this field of study, and the Sussex emphasis on broad interdisciplinary study has been particularly useful in relevant teaching and research.

In the United States, intellectual history is understood more broadly to encompass many different forms of intellectual output, not just the history of political ideas, and it includes such fields as the history of historical thought, associated especially with [[Anthony Grafton]] of [[Princeton University]] and [[J.G.A. Pocock]] of [[Johns Hopkins University]]. Despite the prominence of early modern intellectual historians (those studying the age from the [[Renaissance]] to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]), the intellectual history of the modern period has also been the locus of intense and creative output on both sides of the Atlantic. Prominent examples of such work include [[Louis Menand]]?s [[The Metaphysical Club]] and [[Martin Jay]]?s [[The Dialectical Imagination]].

In continental Europe, equivalents of intellectual history can be found. An example is [[Reinhart Koselleck]]?s ''Begriffsgeschichte'' (history of concepts), though there are methodological differences between the work of Koselleck and his followers and the work of Anglo-American intellectual historians.

== Universal history ==
{{Main|Universal history}}
[[Image:Voltaire.jpg|thumb|[[Voltaire]] was first in [[modern period]] who attempted to write history of the world, without using of religious and nationalistic interpretation of the past.]]
[[Universal history]], the result of a universal, cosmopolitan interpretation of historical events and mankind as a whole, coherent unit, preceded the nationalization of history. In the [[Western world]], this motivation to imagine a universal history became influential in the 18th century when numerous philosophers promoted new cosmopolitan ideologies,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Colonial experience (many [[Europe]]an countries had colonies) exposed society in Europe to numerous different cultures and civilizations. It is also very important to take in consideration that 18th century was in the [[age of enlightenment]] with peoples activities, both on individual and social level, were determined with desire to follow rational scientific judgment while changing the society, which released them from restraints of customs and arbitrary authorities based on [[faith]], [[superstition]], or [[revelation]] and backed up by [[religion]] or [[tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

| quote       = Enlightenment was a desire for human affairs to be guided by rationality rather than by faith, superstition, or revelation; a belief in the power of human reason to change society and liberate the individual from the restraints of custom or arbitrary authority; all backed up by a world view increasingly validated by science rather than by religion or tradition. .}}&lt;/ref&gt; All this circumstances provided suitable surrounding for development of universalistic, liberal and rational global perspectives in studies of society and its past and writing historical texts.

In his ''Essay on customs (1756)'' [[Voltaire]] studied development of civilization in the world with universal perspective, rejecting tradition, Christian and national frames. He was significantly influenced by [[Jacques-B?nigne Bossuet]] and his work ''Discourse on the Universal history (1682)'' when he was first who seriously attempted to write history of the world, without limits imposed by nation or religion, emphasizing economical, cultural and political history. [[Imanuel Kant]] developed idea about universally applicable moral imperatives in his work ''Perpetual Peace (1795)'' and designed a plan for establishing [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] liberal order which would result with perpetual [[peace]]. Universalism of 18th century  created ideology which in modern form could be identified as [[Civil society|modern civil society]].

Emerging of modern historiography is connected with German universities in 19th century and significant influence of [[Leopold von Ranke]] who insisted on objectivity and systematic use of historical documents in shape of authentic primary sources and his credo was to perform reconstruction of the past &quot;as it was&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;A. G. Hopkins, p.2 &quot;Leopold von Ranke founded historical research on the systematic use of documentary evidence, on reconstructing the past `as it was', and on the ideal of objectivity.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Ranke's universal precepts in virtually all his works were, however, applied almost exclusively to the history of states and nations .&lt;ref&gt;A. G. Hopkins, p.2 &quot; These were
universal precepts. In practice, however, they were applied almost exclusively to the history of states and nation states in Europe,.... Virtually all of Ranke's own work,... was devoted to these themes.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes of Nationalization of history ==
Though nationalization of history could probably be traced from the earliest phases of creating historical works, it was period after [[French revolution]] that creating of historical works started to be strongly influenced by national perspectives, and that perspective gradually became globally dominant with its culmination during 19th and at the beginning of 20th century. Nationalism was estimated as proper perspective in such extent, that nationalization of history remained unnoticed till recently (1980s and 1990s) and was not studied in historiography in scale that would correspond to its significance.

Many various reasons, depending on the circumstances, caused nationalization of history. Probably most important is [[Romantic nationalism|national revival]], which important element was nationalized history,&lt;ref&gt;Kasianov, Terr; p. 7, &quot;In some countries nationalization of history was part of &quot;invention of tradition&quot;, while in others it was an element of so called &quot;national renaissance&quot; or &quot;national awakening&quot; ..&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; that resulted with emerging of modern [[nations]] and [[Nation state|nation-states]], mostly during 19th century. With emerging of national states, global universal approach in writing history lost ground to the nation state and was very much captured by it even in significant part of 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;A. G. Hopkins, p. 2 &quot;Nevertheless, the cosmopolitan ideal lost ground to the nation state in the nineteenth century and for the greater part of the twentieth century too, and was to a large degree captured by it.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Professionalization and institutionalization of history|The professionalization and institutionalization of history]] that took part in nation state's institutions during 19th and first half of 20th century was closely connected with process of history's increasing nationalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

G. Hopkins, p. 2, &quot;The tradition of writing national histories was further entrenched in the twentieth century through the development of national curricula in schools and the production of prestigious series, typically described as being `monumental' and `authoritative', that told the `national story' in an insular style and often in a justificatory manner.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[First World War]] was finished, in some cases during establishment of new frontiers, there was principle of national self-determination taken in consideration during frontier [[Demarcation line|demarcation]]. Therefore it was necessary to establish national historical character of certain territories and settlements, like in case between Germany and Poland and Versailles treaty when numerous historians prepared short studies in attempt to support territory demands based of Germany or Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

After [[Second World War]] and process of [[decolonization]], process of establishing new countries that gave additionally stimulated nationalization of history because &quot;new [[flags]] requested new histories&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;A. G. Hopkins, p.2 &quot;This approach was adopted enthusiastically by the new states that came into being following the upheavals brought about by two world wars and decolonization. New flags required new histories.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Even when citizens of newly established countries already had their national identity built, nationalization of history in those cases was aimed to creation of new national identity based on citizenship. [[Canada]] is example of attempt of nationalization of history to create shared, historically rooted identity for English and French Canadians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

== Renationalization of history ==
If first phase of nationalization of history was forcibly suppressed by anational ideology ([[communism]]) or traumatic losing of wars ([[Japan]], [[Germany]], ...) there can be second phase, [[renationalization of history]], on usually changed basis and perspective of nationalism.

=== Renationalization of history on Ukrainian example ===
Nationalization of history in [[Ukraine]] had two separate phases:&lt;ref&gt;Kasianov, Terr, p. 7, &quot;Ukraine experienced nationalization of history in two stages. The first began in mid-nineteenth century and reached its heights in the creation of grand narrative, Mykhailo Hrushevsky's ?History of Ukraine - Rus?. The tradition of historical writings that emerged at this stage persisted in Ukrainian Marxist historiography until the end of Second World War.... In diasporas historiography it turned it into canon, a true credo. The second stage began in 1980s and still continuing. .... It is taking place under state sponsorship and is integral part of nationalization of the state.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''First phase'' began at the middle of 19th century and reached its culmination in [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]]'s ?History of Ukraine - Rus'?. This phase lasted till the end of [[Second World War]] when it was stopped because of political changes in Soviet Union, while in [[diasporas]] Hrushevsky's text had [[cult]] status.
* ''Second phase'' started at the 1980s and still (2010) lasts, as consequence of direct state sponsorship becoming integral part of nationalization of the state. At the beginning, it was not so intensive, but after its turning point on August 24, 1991, it achieved special purposes: to legitimize newly established [[state (polity)|state]] and its governing elites, establishing territorial and chronological conceptions of [[Ukrainian nation]], and to confirm appropriateness of its existence as legal successor in the consciousness of its citizens and neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;Kasianov, Terr,p. 11, &quot;Nationalized history began to fulfil important instrumental functions: legitimize newly established state and its attendant elite, establishing territorial and chronological conceptions of Ukrainian nation, and to confirm nations appropriateness of that nations existence as legal successor in the consciousness of its citizens and neighbours alike.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

First phase chronologically coincided with process of &quot;rediscovery of tradition&quot; and [[Romantic nationalism|national revival]] that captured whole Europe, while second phase takes place in period of globalization, vanishing cultural frontiers and aggressive international forms of [[mass culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Kasianov, Terr, p. 7,&quot;... unlike the previous stage, that coincided with general European phenomenon of &quot;invention of tradition&quot; and the development of the nations, the present stage is unfolding in the era of globalization, fading the cultural boundaries and large-scale aggression of the international forms of mass culture.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Local history

{{Globalize|date=December 2010}}'''Local history''' is the study of [[history]] in a geographically local context and it often concentrates on the [[local community]]. It incorporates [[cultural history|cultural]] and [[social history|social]] aspects of history. Historic plaques are one form of documentation of significant occurrences in the past and [[Oral history|oral histories]] are another. Local history is often documented by local historical societies or groups that form to preserve a local historic building or other historic site. Many works of local history are compiled by amateur historians working independently or archivists employed by various organizations. An important aspect of local history is the publication and cataloguing of documents preserved in local or national records which relate to particular areas.
==Geographically contexts==
Local history tends to be less documented than other types, with fewer books and artifacts than that of a country or continent. Many local histories are recorded as oral tales or stories and so are more vulnerable than more well known issues. Artifacts of local history are often collected in local history museums, which may be housed in a historic house or other building. Individual historic sites are inherently local, although they may have national or world history importance as well. Many however have litlle overall historical impact but add depth to the local area.

===United Kingdom===
The [[British Association for Local History]] in the [[United Kingdom]] encourages and assists in the study of local history as an academic discipline and as a leisure activity by both individuals and groups. Most historic counties in England have record societies and archaeological and historical societies which coordinate the work of historians and other researchers concerned with that area.

Local history in the UK took a long time to be accepted as an academic discipline. In the 18th and 19th centuries, it was widely regarded as an [[antiquarian]] pursuit, suitable for country parsons. The [[Victoria County History|Victoria History of the Counties of England]] project begun in 1899 in honour of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] with the aim of creating an encyclopaedic history of each of the [[historic counties of England]]. The project is coordinated by the [[Institute of Historical Research]] at the [[University of London]]. The first academic post related to local history was at [[Reading University]] which appointed a research fellow in local history in 1908. There was a department of local history (but without a professor) at [[Leicester University]] from 1947. HPR Finberg was the first Professor of English Local History. He was appointed by Leicester in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Local History: Objective and Pursuit|first=HPR|last=Finberg|first2=VHT|last2=Skipp|publisher=David &amp; Charles|year=1967|pages=46?70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local history continues to be neglected as an academic subject within universities. Academic local historians are often found within a more general department of history or in continuing education.

Local history is rarely taught as a separate subject in British schools. In 1908, a Board of Education circular had urged that schools should pay attention &quot;to the history of the town and district&quot; in which they were situated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Local History: Objective and Pursuit|first=HPR|last=Finberg|first2=VHT|last2=Skipp|publisher=David &amp; Charles|year=1967|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, the Ministry of Education suggested schools should use local material to illustrate national themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Local History: Objective and Pursuit|first=HPR|last=Finberg|first2=VHT|last2=Skipp|publisher=David &amp; Charles|year=1967|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the current [[National Curriculum]], pupils at level 4 are expected to &quot;show their knowledge and understanding of local, national and international history&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://curriculum.qcda.gov.uk/key-stages-3-and-4/subjects/key-stage-3/history/Level-descriptions/index.aspx National Curriculum - level descriptions]&lt;/ref&gt;'''

===United States===
In the [[United States of America]], local history is usually concentrated on any history of the place and people from a particular [[village]] or [[township]]. Several villages and townships would comprise one county or county history. Library records are often divided by State, then county, then township/local history. The American Local History Network (ALHN) in the [[USA]] provides a focus for accessing independent genealogical and historical resources.

In the United States, 79,000 historic sites are identified as listings on its [[National Register of Historic Places]].  State and local municipalities often have additional landmark designations to cover sites of more purely local interest.

In addition, many regional and state [[historical societies]] maintain regional history and actively seek out missing historical collections.

===Russia, Ukraine and the former Soviet Union===
In the USSR, Russia and Russian-speaking post-Soviet states local history is known as ''krayevedenie'' and taught in primary schools. There are also local history museums known as ''krayevedcheskie muzei''.

In [[Ukraine]], the study of local history is known as ''krayeznavstvo'' ({{lang-uk|[[:uk:????????????|????????????]]}}).

==Artistic genre uses ==
The Scottish novel, ''[[The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner]]'' (1824) by [[James Hogg]], a dark study of criminal psychology and religious fanaticism, is essentially structured in all respects as a local history publication of the kind fashionable in [[Scotland]] in Hogg's lifetime.

{{sociology}}'''Historical sociology''' is a branch of [[sociology]] focusing on how [[society|societies]] develop through [[history]]. It looks at how [[social structure]] that many regard as natural are in fact shaped by complex [[social process]]es. The structure in turn shapes institutions and organizations, and they affect the society - resulting in phenomena ranging from [[gender bias]], [[income inequality]] and [[war]].
Contemporary historical sociology is primarily concerned with how the [[State (polity)|state]] has developed since the [[Middle Ages]], analyzing relations between states, classes, economic and political systems.

==The use of history in sociology==
A common phrase regarding this subject is &quot;Sociology is history with the hard work left out; history is sociology with the brains left out&quot;. As time has passed, History and Sociology have historically developed into two different specific academic disciplines. Historical data was used and is used today in mainly these three ways. There are many other ways and Sociologists can add different theories to it. The first one is: Examining a theory through a Parallel investigation. To correspond with the natural-science conceptions of laws, and to look at, or apply various historical material where you gather your resources in order to prove the theory that is applied. Or on the other hand sociologists for the parallel investigation theory could apply the theory to certain cases of investigation but in a different modalities of a more widely used process.The second theory that Sociologists mainly use: applying and contrasting certain events or policies. Analyzed by their specific, or what makes them in unique quality of a composition, certain events used by the Sociologist for comparative data can be contrasted and compared. For interpretive Sociologists it is very common for them to use the 'Verstehen' tradition.  And lastly, the third way sociologists typically relate is by taking a look at the causalities from a macro point of view. This is Mill's method: &quot; a) principle of difference: a case with effect and cause present is contrasted with a case with effect and cause absent; and b) principle of agreement: cases with same effects are compared in terms of their (ideally identical) causes. There is an important debate on the usefulness of Mill?s method for sociological research, which relates to the fact that historical research is often based on only few cases and that many sociological theories are probabilistic, not deterministic.&lt;ref&gt;Deflem, Mathieu. 1997. &quot;On the Methodology of Historical Sociology: Scattered Notes&lt;/ref&gt;. Today, historical sociology is measured by a conjunction of questions that are rich in detail&lt;ref&gt;Clemens, Elizabeth S. &quot;Toward a Historicized Sociology: Theorizing Events, Processes, and Emergence.&quot; EBSCOhost. Web. Oct.-Nov. 2010. &lt;http://ezp.tccd.edu:2321/ehost/detail?vid=3&amp;hid=119&amp;sid=cd26f66e-45f2-493d-804f-c67b713823ae%40sessionmgr114&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=pbh&amp;AN=26613934&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Path dependence in historical sociology==
[[Path dependence]] to some Sociologists is the theory that events that happened in past, have some or a lot of influence on events that happen in the future. However the Sociologist Mahoney has a different defintion of path dependence. This theory suggests that &quot;process, sequence, and temporality&quot; have a valid reason for affecting path dependence and the meaning of past historical events. There are three path-dependent analyses with an explanation to how each theory works. &quot;1) the study of causal processes that are especially sensitive, in a sequence, to early historical events, which are more important than later events; 2) these events are contingent occurrences that cannot be explained by prior events or initial conditions; and 3) that once contingent events take place, the path dependent sequence becomes a deterministic pattern.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mahoney, James. &quot;Path Dependence in Historical Sociology.&quot; Welcome to the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of South Carolina. 2007. Web. 2 Nov. 2010. &lt;http://www.cas.sc.edu/socy/faculty/deflem/zcomphistnotes.html#problems&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The debate over general theory in sociology==
A sociologist James Mahoney revisited the debate over [[general theory]] in Historical Sociology. By bridging the gaps of different assumptions, casual agents and causual mechanisms are connected to the empirical analysis, and this is seen as the general theory. &quot;...the debate over general theory in historical sociology with the goal of clarifying the use of this kind of theory in empirical research. General theories are defined as postulates about causal agents and causal mechanisms that are linked to empirical analysis through bridging assumptions. These theories can contribute to substantive knowledge by helping analysts derive new hypotheses, integrate existing findings, and explain historical outcomes. To illustrate these applications, the article considers five different general theories that have guided or could guide historical sociology: functionalist, rational choice, power, neo-Darwinian, and cultural theories. A key conclusion that emerges is that scholars must evaluate both the overall merits of general theory and the individual merits of specific general theories&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Mahoney, James. &quot;Revisiting General Theory in Historical Sociology.&quot; EBSCOhost.

{{Sociology}}'''Comparative Historical Research''' is a method of social science that examines historical events in order to create explanations that are valid beyond a particular time and place, either by direct comparison to other historical events, theory building, or reference to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;Mission of the Comparative and Historical Sociology Section of the American Sociological Association. [http://www2.asanet.org/sectionchs/sectioninfo.html www2.asanet.org/sectionchs/sectioninfo.html] (Accessed 15 December 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, it involves comparisons of social processes across times and places. It overlaps with [[historical sociology]]. While the disciplines of [[History]] and [[Sociology]] have always been connected, they have connected in different ways at different times (see Major Researchers below). This form of research may use any of several theoretical orientations. It is distinguished by the types of questions it asks, not the theoretical framework it employs (see Illustrations below).
== Major researchers ==
Some commentators have identified three waves of historical comparative research.&lt;ref&gt;J. Adams, E.S. Clemens, and A.S. Orloff. 2005. ''Remaking Modernity: Politics, History, and Sociology''. Duke University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The first wave of historical comparative research concerned how societies came to be [[Modernity|modern]], i.e. based on individual and rational action, with exact definitions varying widely. Some of the major researchers in this mode were [[Alexis de Tocqueville]],&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''[[Democracy In America]]''. 1969 [1835-40]. Trans. George Lawrence. Perennial Classics.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Marx]],&lt;ref&gt;For example, &quot;[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon|The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte]].&quot; 1979 [1852]. In [[Marx/Engels Collected Works]], Vol. 11. International Publishers. pg. 99-197.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emile Durkheim]],&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''[[The Division of Labor in Society]]''. 1984 [1893]. Trans. W.D. Halls. The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Weber]],&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''[[Economy and Society|Economy And Society: An Outline of Interpretive Sociology]]''. 1968 [1922]. Ed. Guenther Roth and Claus Wittich. University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[W.E.B. DuBois]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''The Suppression of the African Slave Trade to the United States of America 1638-1870''. In W.E.B. DuBois Writings. Library of America. pg. 1-356.&lt;/ref&gt; The second wave reacted to a perceived ahistorical body of theory and sought to show how social systems were not static, but developed over time.&lt;ref&gt;D. Smith. 1991. ''The Rise of Historical Sociology''. Temple University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Notable authors of this wave include [[Barrington Moore, Jr.]],&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy: Lord and Peasant in the Making of the Modern World''. 1966. Beacon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theda Skocpol]],&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''[[States and Social Revolutions|States and Social Revolutions: A Comparative Analysis of France, Russia, and China]]''. 1979. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Tilly]],&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''Coercion, Capital, and European States, AD 990-1992''. 1992. Blackwell Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Mann (sociologist)|Michael Mann]],&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''The Sources of Social Power'', Vols. 1-2. 1986-93. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and Mark Gould.&lt;ref&gt;''Revolution in the Development of Capitalism: The Coming of the English Revolution''. 1987. University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Some have placed the Annales school and Pierre Bourdieu in this general group, despite their stylistic differences.&lt;ref&gt;For example, P. Bourdieu. 1988 [1984]. ''Homo Academicus''. Trans. Peter Collier. Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The current wave of historical comparative research sociology is often but not exclusively post-structural in its theoretical orientation. Influential current authors include Julia Adams,&lt;ref&gt;For example, &quot;The Rule of the Father: Patriarchy and Patrimonialism in Early Modern Europe.&quot; 2005. In ''Max Weber's Economy and Society: A Critical Companion''. Ed. C. Camic, P.S. Gorski, and D.M. Trubek. Stanford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Anne Laura Stoler,&lt;ref&gt;''Carnal Knowledge and Imperial Power: Race and the Intimate in Colonial Rule''. 2002. University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Philip Gorski,&lt;ref&gt;''The Disciplinary Revolution: Calvinism and the Rise of the State in Early Modern Europe''. 2003. University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and James Mahoney.&lt;ref&gt;J. Mahoney. 2003. &quot;Knowledge Accumulation in Comparative Historical Research: The Case of Democracy and Authoritarianism.&quot; In ''Comparative Historical Analysis in the Social Sciences''. Ed. J. Mahoney and D. Rueschemeyer. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==
There are four major methods that researchers use to collect historical data. These are archival data, secondary sources, running records, and recollections. The archival data, or primary sources, are typically the resources that researchers rely most heavily on. Archival data includes official documents and other items that would be found in archives, museums, etc.  Secondary sources are the works of other historians who have written history. Running records are ongoing series of statistical or other sorts of data, such as census data, ship's registries, property deeds, etc. Finally recollections include sources such as autobiographies, memoirs or diaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.ncwc.edu/toconnor/308/308lect09.htm |title=UNKNOWN |accessdate=2007-11-27 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071031062230/http://faculty.ncwc.edu/toconnor/308/308lect09.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four stages, as discussed by Schutt, to systematic qualitative comparative historical studies: (1) develop the premise of the investigation, identifying events, concepts, etc., that may explain the phenomena; (2) choose the case(s) (location- nation, region) to examine; (3) use what Theda Skocpol has termed as &quot;interpretive historical sociology&quot; and examine the similarities and the differences; and (4) based on the information gathered, propose a casual explanation for the phenomena.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schutt&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Schutt |first=R. K. |year=2006 |title=Investigating the Social World: The Process and Practice of Research |location=London |publisher=SAGE Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The key issues in methods for historical comparative research stem from the incomplete nature of historical data, the complexity and scale of the social systems, and the nature of the questions asked. Historical data is a difficult set of data to work with due to multiple factors. This data set can be very biased, such as diaries, memoirs, letters, which are all influenced not only by the person writing them, that person's world view but can also, logically, be linked to that individual's socioeconomic status.  In this way the data can be corrupt/skewed. Historical data regardless or whether it may or may not be biased (diaries vs. official documents) is also vulnerable to time. Time can destroy fragile paper, fade ink until it is illegible, wars, environmental disasters can all destroy data and special interest groups can destroy mass amounts of data to serve a specific purpose at the time they lived, etc. Hence, data is naturally incomplete and can lead social scientists to many barriers in their research. Often historical comparative research is a broad and wide reaching topic such as how democracy evolved in three specific regions. Tracking how democracy developed is a daunting task for one country or region let alone three. Here the scale of the social system, which is attempting to be studied, is overwhelming but also the complexity is extreme. Within each case there are multiple different social systems that can affect the development of a society and its political system. The factors must be separated and analyzed so that causality can be attained. It is causality that brings us to yet another key issue in methods for historical comparative research, the nature of the questions which are asked is attempting to propose causal relationships between a set of variables. Determining causality alone is a difficult task; coupled with the incomplete nature of historical data and the complexity and scale of the social systems being used to examine causality the task becomes even more challenging.

==Identifying features==
The three identifying issues of historical comparative research are causal relationships, processes over time, and comparisons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schutt&quot;/&gt;  As mentioned above causal relationships are difficult to support although we make causal assumptions daily. Schutt discusses the five criteria, which must be met in order to have a causal relationship. Of the five the first three are the most important: association, time order and nonspuriousness. Association simply means that between two variables; the change in one variable is related to the change in another variable. Time order refers to the fact that the cause (the independent variable) must be shown to have occurred first and the effect (the dependent variable) to have occurred second. Nonspuriousness says that the association between two variables is not because of a third variable. The final two criteria are; identifying a causal mechanism- how the connection/association among variables is thought to have occurred- and the context in which this association occurs. The deterministic causal approach requires that in every study, the independent and dependent variable have an association, and within that study every case (nation, region) the independent variable has an effect on the dependent variable.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schutt&quot;/&gt;

[[John Stuart Mill]] devised five methods for systematically analyzing observations and making more accurate assumptions about causality. [[Mill's Methods]] discusses; direct method of agreement, method of difference, joint method of agreement and difference, method of residues and method of concomitant variations. Mill's methods are typically the most useful when the causal relationship is already suspected and can therefore be a tool for eliminating other explanations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philosophypages.com/lg/e14.htm |title=UNKNOWN |accessdate=2007-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some methodologists contend Mill's methods cannot provide proof that the variation in one variable was caused by the variation of another variable.

== Difficulties ==
There are several difficulties that historical comparative research faces. James Mahoney, one of the current leading figures in historical comparative research, identifies several of these in his book &quot;Comparative Historical Analysis in the Social Sciences.&quot; Mahoney highlights key issues such as how micro level studies can be incorporated into the macro level field of historical comparative research, issues ripe for historical comparative research that continue to remain overlooked, such as law, and the issue of whether historical comparative research should be approached as a science or approached as a history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mahoney&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Mahoney, |first=J |coauthors=Rueschemeyer, D. |year=2003 |title=Comparative historical analysis of the social sciences |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the more prevalent debates today, often debated between [[Theda Skocpol]], who sides with the historical approach, and Kiser and Hechter, who are proponents of the scientific view that should search for general causal principles.  Both Kiser and Hechter employ models within [[Rational Choice Theory]] for their general causal principles.  Historical researchers that oppose them (Skocpol, Summers, others) argue that Kiser and Hechter do not suggest many other plausible general theories, and thus it seems as though their advocacy for general theories is actually advocacy for their preferred general theory.  They also raise other criticisms of using rational choice theory in historical comparative research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://66.218.69.11/search/cache?ei=UTF-8&amp;p=kiser+hechter&amp;fr=yfp-t-501&amp;u=www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN%3D0226305651/hanswienholdsfan/&amp;w=kiser+hechter&amp;d=O27yYudmPd0K&amp;icp=1&amp;.intl=us |title=UNKNOWN |accessdate=2007-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Role of general theory ===

In recent decades historical comparative researchers have debated the proper role of general theory.  Two of the main players in this debate have been Edgar Kiser and Michael Hechter.  They have argued that it is important to use a general theory in order to be able to test the results of the research that has been conducted.  They do not argue that one specific theory is better than the other just that a theory needs to be used.  Their chosen theory is rational choice.  One of the main problems is that everyone has a different concept of what a theory is and what makes something a theory.  Some of their opponents feel that any theory can be tested and they are arguing that some cannot be.  Kiser and Hecter do acknowledge that this is a growing field and that their perspective may change in the future.

==Illustrations==

The comparative-historical method can be clarified with a recent and highly-regarded example. In ''The Familial State'', Julia Adams draws on both original archival work and secondary sources to analyze how merchant families contested with noble families for influence in the early modern [[Dutch Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Adams. 2005. ''The Familial State: Ruling Families and Merchant Capitalism in Early Modern Europe''. Cornell University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Adams argues that those contests produced the political institutions that became the modern Dutch state. She frequently makes reference to [[England]] and [[France]], but the main topic is the Dutch Republic. Adams examines what earlier sociologists said about state formation in light of the Dutch case, finding there are decisive elements in the Dutch Republic, like patriarchal kinship structures in the ruling families, that aren't accounted for in the earlier theories. Adams draws on feminist theory, which was not originally intended to explain modern state formation, to create an expanded theory of how modern states came to be. This is an illustration of how comparative-historical analysis uses cases and theories together.

Elegant decay

'''Elegant Decay''' is the distinct cultural/historical concept that some places, and structures, become gradually more elegant, notable or beautiful as they decay, or fall into ruin, due to their historical, architectural and/or cultural significance. Although such reverence can often be merely in the opinion of individuals, it is true that certain cities, regions or even countries are more susceptible to the general concept due to past opulence, or their lengthy or enduring history or culture.

[[File:Rome Palatine Hill.jpg|thumb|360px|A bend in the path to the summit of Palatine Hill, in Rome, Italy]]

Contrary to the general interpretation that places or structures are more noteworthy in their newness, or older structures hold more value and interest in being historically restored to their original state, the concept of elegant decay is that in the slow degradation of the structures an inherent elegance, or beauty, emerges due to past historic importance. In more recent times, this concept has gradually become more important for regions to cultivate a more vibrant tourist industry.

==History==
[[File:Venice Windows.jpg|thumb|360px|A wall in Venice, Italy, slowly crumbles into a canal.]]

With its rich history, and centuries of past prestige and prominence, [[Western Europe]] has many places where elegant decay is notable, and celebrated, today. One of the most famous countries is Italy, due to its lengthy historic prominence in prehistoric, ancient, medieval and modern times. Possibly the most celebrated of Italian cities in elegant decay would be [[Venice]], largely due to the whole city slowly crumbling, and sinking, into the lagoon which it is in.

Although Western Europe holds many instances of elegant decay today, the New World also has places of crumbled reverence as well. Most notable in the United States may be the city and region around [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], with a historic fusion of cultures, and legacies of hatred and darkness. In the concept of elegant decay, there appears to sometimes be an element of impending doom to such places and structures, as Venice, Italy, slowly sinks, and New Orleans is always under threat of the tides.

It is of note that elegant decay is different in concept and plan than [[ruin value]], in which structures are planned to look beautiful in ruin from the early planning stages.
The concept of elegant decay is related to the concept of [[patina]].

'''Professionalization and institutionalization of history''' is term used in [[historiography]] to describe process of professionalization of the historical discipline with historians becoming professionals through process of special education, and genesis of [[Historical institutionalism|historical institutions]] they founded.== Professionalization of history ==
During process of [[professionalization]] of history being historian became not only occupation but [[profession]] of the highest integrity and competence. Professionalization of history is the process of acquiring the following characteristics of profession for occupation of historian:
# prolonged training in definable body of knowledge,
# a [[credential]] system,
# a [[code of ethics]],
# a [[self-government]]
# legislated access to particular [[labour market]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

This process results with privileged access to financial and social rewards for its members.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''The professionalization of history in English Canada'', page 4&lt;/ref&gt;

== Institutionalization of history ==
The term [[institutionalisation]] is widely used in social theory to refer to the process of embedding something (for example a concept, a social role, a particular value or mode of behaviour) within an organisation, social system, or society as a whole.

A body politic comprises all the people in a particular country considered as a single group. The [[analogy]] is typically continued by reference to the apex of government as the [[head of state]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Body politic: political metaphor and political violence |author=A. D. Harvey |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing |year=2007 |isbn=9781847182722}}&lt;/ref&gt; but may be extended to other anatomical parts, as in political readings of the [[Aesop's fable]] [[The Belly and the Members]]. The metaphor also appears in the French language as the ''corps-?tat''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The body politic: corporeal metaphor in revolutionary France, 1770-1800 |author=Antoine de Baecque |publisher=Stanford University Press |year=1997 |isbn=9780804728171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The metaphor developed in [[Renaissance]] times, as the medical knowledge based upon the classical work of [[Galen]] was being challenged by new thinkers such as [[William Harvey]].  Analogies were made between the supposed causes of disease and disorder and their equivalents in the political field which were considered to be [[plague]]s or infections which might be remedied by [[purgative|purges]] and [[nostrum]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Foreign bodies and the body politic: discourses of social pathology in early modern England |author=Jonathan Harris |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1998 |isbn=9780521594059}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The concept can be seen in the [[Massachusetts Constitution of 1780]], which declares: &quot;The body politic is formed by a [[voluntary association]] of individuals; it is a [[social compact]] by which the whole people covenants with each citizen and each citizen with the whole people&quot; But it is summarized very simply in the words of the [[Declaration of Independence]], which posits as a self-evident truth &quot;that to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the [[consent of the governed]].&quot; [http://www.amazon.com/STILL-HOLD-THESE-TRUTHS-Rediscovering/dp/1935191926/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322101027&amp;sr=1-1]

In some cases (for example, the [[Holy Roman Empire]]) such a leader may be elected, yet wield much lesser powers than those of his predecessor. Feudal fragmentation is related to the concepts of [[agnatic seniority]] and [[principat (Slavic)|principate]].&lt;ref name=PWN/&gt;

{{About|practitioners of the scholarly pursuit of antiquarianism|the trade in old books|Bookselling|trading or collecting old objects|Antique}}[[Image:Musei Wormiani Historia.jpg|thumb|330px|[[Ole Worm]]'s [[cabinet of curiosities]], from ''Museum Wormianum,'' 1655.]]An '''antiquarian''' or '''antiquary''' (from the Latin ''antiquarius'', meaning pertaining to ancient times) is an [[aficionado]] or student of [[antiquities]] or things of the past. More specifically, the term is used for those who study [[history]] with particular attention to ancient objects of art or science, archaeological and historic [[Archaeological site|sites]], or historic [[archive]]s and [[manuscript]]s. The essence of antiquarianism is a focus on the [[Empiricism|empirical]] evidence of the past, and is perhaps best encapsulated in the motto adopted by the 18th-century antiquary, [[Sir Richard Hoare, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Colt Hoare]], &quot;We speak from facts not theory&quot;.

Today the term is often used in a pejorative sense, to refer to an excessively narrow focus on factual historical trivia, to the exclusion of a sense of historical context or process.

In [[ancient Rome]], a strong [[mos maiorum|sense of traditionalism]] motivated an interest in studying and recording the &quot;monuments&quot; of the past; the [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Augustan]] historian [[Livy]] uses the Latin ''monumenta'' in the sense of &quot;antiquarian matters.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''Ab Urbe Condita'' 7.3.7: cited also in the ''[[Oxford Latin Dictionary]]'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1982, 1985 reprinting), p. 1132, entry on ''monumentum'', as an example of meaning 4b, &quot;recorded tradition.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Books on antiquarian topics covered such subjects as the origin of customs, [[Religion in ancient Rome|religious rituals]], and [[Roman constitution|political institutions]]; genealogy; topography and landmarks; and [[etymology]]. [[Annals]] and [[Roman historiography|histories]] might also include sections pertaining to these subjects, but annals are chronological in structure, and [[Roman historiography|Roman histories]], such as those of Livy and [[Tacitus]], are both chronological and offer an overarching narrative and interpretation of events. By contrast, antiquarian works as a literary form are organized by topic, and any narrative is short and illustrative, in the form of [[anecdote]]s.

Major antiquarian [[Latin literature|Latin writers]] with surviving works include [[Varro]], [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Aulus Gellius]], and [[Macrobius]]. The Roman emperor [[Claudius]] published antiquarian works, none of which is extant. Some of [[Cicero]]'s treatises, particularly [[De Divinatione|his work on divination]], show strong antiquarian interests, but their primary purpose is the exploration of philosophical questions. Roman-era [[Ancient Greek literature|Greek writers]] also dealt with antiquarian material, such as [[Plutarch]]  in his ''Roman Questions''&lt;ref&gt;At [[LacusCurtius]], Bill Thayer presents an edition of the ''[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Roman_Questions*/home.html Roman Questions]'' based on the [[Loeb Classical Library]] translation. Thayer's edition can be browsed question-by-question in tabulated form, with direct links to individual topics.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Deipnosophistae]]'' of [[Athenaeus]]. The aim of Latin antiquarian works is to collect a great number of possible explanations, with less emphasis on arriving at a truth than in compiling the evidence. The antiquarians are often used as sources by the ancient historians, and many antiquarian writers are known only through these citations.&lt;ref&gt;This overview of Roman antiquarianism is based on [[T.P. Wiseman]], ''Clio's Cosmetics'' (Bristol: Phoenix Press, 2003, originally published 1979 by Leicester University Press), pp. 15?15, 45 ''et passim''; and ''A Companion to Latin Literature'', edited by Stephen Harrison (Blackwell, 2005), pp. 37?38, 64, 77, 229, 242?244 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval and early modern antiquarianism===
Despite the importance of antiquarian writing in the [[Latin literature|literature of ancient Rome]], some scholars view antiquarianism as emerging only in the [[Middle Ages]] (see [[History of archaeology]]).&lt;ref name=Daly-35&gt;{{citation|title=Egyptology: The Missing Millennium : Ancient Egypt in Medieval Arabic Writings|first=Okasha|last=El Daly|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2004|isbn=1-84472-063-2|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval antiquarians sometimes made collections of inscriptions or records of monuments, but the Varro-inspired concept of ''antiquitates'' among the Romans as the &quot;systematic collections of all the [[relic]]s of the past&quot; faded.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnaldo Momigliano]], &quot;Ancient History and the Antiquarian,&quot; ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'' 13 (1950), p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt; Antiquarianism's wider flowering is more generally associated with the [[Renaissance]], and with the critical assessment and questioning of [[Classical antiquity|classical]] texts undertaken in that period by [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] scholars. Textual criticism soon broadened into an awareness of the supplementary perspectives on the past which could be offered by the study of [[Numismatics|coins]], [[Epigraphy|inscriptions]] and other archaeological remains, as well as documents from medieval periods.  Antiquaries often formed collections of these and other objects; [[cabinet of curiosities]] is a general term for early collections, which often encompassed antiquities and more recent art, items of natural history, [[memorabilia]] and items from far-away lands.

[[Image:William Camden Clarenceux.jpg|thumb|left|[[William Camden]] (1551?1623), author of the ''Britannia'', wearing the [[tabard]] and [[chain of office]] of [[Clarenceux King of Arms]]. Originally published in the 1695 edition of ''Britannia''.]]
The importance placed on [[ancestor|lineage]] in [[Early modern period|early modern]] Europe meant that antiquarianism was often closely associated with [[genealogy]], and a number of prominent antiquaries (including [[Robert Glover (officer of arms)|Robert Glover]], [[William Camden]], [[William Dugdale]] and [[Elias Ashmole]]) held office as professional [[herald]]s. The development of genealogy as a &quot;scientific&quot; discipline (i.e. one that rejected unsubstantiated legends, and demanded high standards of proof for its claims) went hand-in-hand with the development of antiquarianism. Genealogical antiquaries recognised the evidential value for their researches of non-textual sources, including [[Seal (emblem)|seals]] and [[church monuments]].

Many [[Early modern period|early modern]] antiquaries were also [[Chorography|chorographers]]: that is to say, they recorded landscapes and monuments within regional or national descriptions. In England, some of the most important of these took the form of [[English county histories|county histories]].

In the context of the 17th-century [[scientific revolution]], and more specifically that of the  &quot;[[Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns]]&quot; in England and France, the antiquaries were firmly on the side of the &quot;Moderns&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levine, Battle of the Books&quot;&gt;Levine, ''Battle of the Books''.&lt;/ref&gt; They increasingly argued that empirical [[Primary source|primary]] evidence could be used to refine and challenge the received interpretations of history handed down from literary authorities.

===19th-21st centuries===
By the end of the 19th century, antiquarianism had diverged into a number of more specialized academic disciplines including [[archaeology]], [[art history]], [[numismatics]], [[sigillography]], [[philology]], [[Literary criticism|literary studies]] and [[diplomatics]]. Antiquaries had always attracted a degree of ridicule (see below), and since the mid-19th century the term has tended to be used most commonly in negative or derogatory contexts. Nevertheless, many practising antiquaries continue to claim the title with pride. In recent years, in a scholarly environment in which [[interdisciplinarity]] is increasingly encouraged, many of the established antiquarian societies (see below) have found new roles as facilitators for collaboration between specialists.

==Verbal distinctions==
===Antiquaries and antiquarians===
&quot;Antiquary&quot; was the usual term in English from the 16th to the mid-18th centuries to describe a person interested in antiquities (the word &quot;antiquarian&quot; being generally found only in an [[Adjective|adjectival]] sense). From the second half of the eighteenth century, however, &quot;antiquarian&quot; began to be used more widely as a noun, and today both forms are equally acceptable.

===Antiquaries and historians===
From the 16th to the 19th centuries, a clear distinction was perceived to exist between the interests and activities of the antiquary and the [[historian]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Levine, Battle of the Books&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, &quot;Erudition and the Idea of History&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levine, ''Humanism and History'', pp.&amp;nbsp;54?72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levine, ''Amateur and Professional'', pp.&amp;nbsp;28?30, 80-81.&lt;/ref&gt; The antiquary was concerned with the relics of the past (whether [[document]]s, [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]] or [[Archaeological site|monuments]]), whereas the historian was concerned with the [[Narrative history|narrative]] of the past, and its political or moral lessons for the present. The skills of the antiquary tended to be those of the critical examination and interrogation of his sources, whereas those of the historian were those of the philosophical and literary reinterpretation of received narratives. These distinctions began to be eroded in the second half of the nineteenth century as the school of [[Empiricism|empirical]] source-based history championed by [[Leopold von Ranke]] began to find widespread acceptance, and today's historians employ the full range of techniques pioneered by the early antiquaries. Rosemary Sweet suggests that 18th-century antiquaries
:&quot;probably had more in common with the professional historian of the twenty-first century, in terms of methodology, approach to sources and the struggle to reconcile erudition with style, than did the authors of the grand narratives of national history&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sweet, ''Antiquaries'', p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antiquarians, antiquarian books and antiques===
In many European languages, the word antiquarian (or its equivalent) has shifted in modern times to refer to a person who either trades in or collects rare and ancient [[Antiquarian bookseller|antiquarian books]]; or who trades in or collects [[Antique|antique objects]] more generally. In English, however, the word (either as antiquarian or antiquary) very rarely carries this sense. An antiquarian is primarily a ''student'' of ancient books, documents, artefacts or monuments. Many antiquarians have also built up extensive personal [[Collecting|collections]] in order to inform their studies, but a far greater number have not; and conversely many collectors of books or antiques would not regard themselves (or be regarded) as antiquarians.

[[Image:Rowlandson Death &amp; Antiquaries.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Thomas Rowlandson]]'s caricature, ''Death and the Antiquaries'', 1816. A group of antiquaries cluster eagerly around the exhumed corpse of a king, oblivious to the jealous figure of Death aiming his dart at one of them. The image was inspired by the opening of the tomb of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] in [[Westminster Abbey Burials and Memorials|Westminster Abbey]] by the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]] in 1774.]]

==Pejorative associations==
Antiquaries often appeared to possess an unwholesome interest in death, decay, and the unfashionable; while their focus on obscure and arcane details meant that they seemed to lack an awareness both of the realities and practicalities of modern life, and of the wider currents of history. For all these reasons they frequently became objects of ridicule.&lt;ref&gt;B.S. Allen, ''Tides in English Taste (1619?1800)'', 2 vols (Cambridge, Mass., 1937), vol. 2, pp.&amp;nbsp;87?92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, ''Hobby-Horsical Antiquary'', esp. pp.&amp;nbsp;13?17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sweet, ''Antiquaries'', pp. xiii, 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; The antiquary was satirised in [[John Earle (bishop)|John Earle]]'s ''Micro-cosmographie'' of 1628 (&quot;Hee is one that hath that unnaturall disease to bee enamour'd of old age, and wrinkles, and loves all things (as Dutchmen doe Cheese) the better for being mouldy and worme-eaten&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;John Earle, &quot;An Antiquarie&quot;, in ''Micro-cosmographie'' (London, 1628), sigs [B8]v-C3v.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Jean-Sim?on Chardin]]'s painting &quot;Le Singe Antiquaire&quot; (''c''.1726), in Sir [[Walter Scott]]'s novel ''[[The Antiquary]]'' (1816), in the caricatures of [[Thomas Rowlandson]], and in many other places. The word's resonances were close to those of modern terms for individuals with obsessive interests in technical minutiae, such as [[nerd]], [[Railfan|trainspotter]] or [[Anorak (slang)|anorak]].

In his essay &quot;On the Uses and Abuses of History for Life&quot; from his ''Untimely Meditations'', [[philosopher]] [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] examines three forms of [[history]]. One of these is [[antiquarian history]], an objectivising historicism which forges little or no creative connection between past and present. Nietzsche's [[philosophy of history]] had a significant impact on [[critical history]] in the 20th century.

C.R. Cheney, writing in 1956, observed that &quot;[a]t the present day we have reached such a pass that the word 'antiquary' is not always held in high esteem, while 'antiquarianism' is almost a term of abuse&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;C.R. Cheney, &quot;Introduction&quot;, in Levi Fox (ed.), ''English Historical Scholarship in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries'' (London, 1956), p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; Professional historians still often use the term &quot;antiquarian&quot; in a pejorative sense, to refer to historical studies which seem concerned only to place on record trivial or inconsequential facts, and which fail to consider the wider implications of these, or to formulate any kind of argument. The term is also sometimes applied to the activities of amateur historians such as [[Historical reenactment|historical reenactors]], who may have a meticulous approach to reconstructing the costumes or [[material culture]] of past eras, but who are perceived to lack much understanding of the cultural values and historical contexts of the periods in question.

==Antiquarian societies==
A [[College of Antiquaries|College (or Society) of Antiquaries]] was founded in London in ''c''.1586, to debate matters of antiquarian interest. Members included [[William Camden]], [[Robert Bruce Cotton|Sir Robert Cotton]], [[John Stow]], [[William Lambarde]], [[Richard Carew (antiquary)|Richard Carew]] and others. This body existed till 1604, when it fell under suspicion of being political in its aims, and was abolished by King [[James I of England|James I]]. Papers read at their meetings are preserved in [[Cottonian library|Cotton's collections]], and were printed by [[Thomas Hearne]] in 1720 under the title ''A Collection of Curious Discourses'', a second edition appearing in 1771.

[[File:Soc Antiq 2010.JPG|thumb|right|The entrance to the premises of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]], at [[Burlington House]], [[Piccadilly]].]]
In 1707 a number of English antiquaries began to hold regular meetings for the discussion of their hobby and in 1717 the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]] was formally reconstituted, finally receiving a charter from King [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] in 1751. In 1780 King [[George III of Great Britain|George III]] granted the society apartments in [[Somerset House]], and in 1874 it moved into its present accommodation in [[Burlington House]]. The society was governed by a council of twenty and a president who is ''ex officio'' a trustee of the [[British Museum]].

The [[Society of Antiquaries of Scotland]] was founded in 1780 and had the management of a large national antiquarian museum in [[Edinburgh]].

The [[Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne]], the oldest provincial antiquarian society in England, was founded in 1813.

In [[Ireland]] a society was founded in 1849 called the Kilkenny Archaeological Society, holding its meetings at [[Kilkenny]]. In 1869 its name was changed to the Royal Historical and Archaeological Association of Ireland, and in 1890 to the [[Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland]], its office being transferred to [[Dublin]].

In [[France]] the ''[[Soci?t? des Antiquaires de France]]'' was formed in 1813 by the reconstruction of the ''Acad?mie Celtique'', which had existed since 1804.

The [[American Antiquarian Society]] was founded in 1812, with its headquarters at [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], [[Massachusetts]]. It had a library of upwards of 100,000 volumes and its transactions have been published bi-annually since 1820.

In [[Denmark]], the ''Kongelige Nordiske Oldskriftselskab'' (also known as ''La Soci?t? Royale des Antiquaires du Nord'' or the Royal Society of Northern Antiquaries) was founded at [[Copenhagen]] in 1825.

In [[Germany]] the ''Gesamtverein der Deutschen Geschichts und Altertumsvereine'' was founded in 1852.

Sinecure

{{Wiktionary}}A '''sinecure''' (from [[Latin]] ''sine'' = &quot;without&quot; and ''cura'' = &quot;care&quot;) means an office that requires or involves little or no responsibility, labour, or active service. The term originated in the medieval church, where it signified a post without any responsibility for the &quot;cure of souls&quot;, the regular liturgical and pastoral functions of a cleric, but came to be applied to any post, secular or ecclesiastical, that involved little or no actual work. Sinecures have historically provided a potent tool for governments or monarchs to distribute [[patronage]], while recipients are able to store up titles and easy salaries.

A sinecure is not necessarily a [[figurehead (political)|figurehead]], which generally requires active participation in government, albeit with a lack of power. A sinecure, by contrast, has no real day-to-day responsibilities, but may have [[de jure]] power.

A sinecure can also be given to an individual whose primary job is in another office, but requires a sinecure title to perform that job. For example, the [[Leader of the Government in the House of Commons (Canada)|Government House Leader]] in Canada is often given a sinecure ministry position so that he may become a member of the [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet]]. Similar examples are the [[Lord Privy Seal]] and the [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]] in the British cabinet. Other sinecures operate as [[legal fiction]]s, such as the British office of [[Crown Steward and Bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds]], used as a legal excuse for [[resignation from the British House of Commons|resigning from Parliament]].

==History==
[[File:Tizian 109.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Girolamo and cardinal [[Marco Corner]] investing Marco, abbot of [[Carrara]], with his [[benefice]], [[Titian]], ca 1520&lt;/center&gt;]]
''[[Sinecure]]'', properly a term of [[ecclesiastical law]] for a [[benefice]] without the cure of souls, in the [[Church of England|English Church]] arose when the [[rector]] had no cure of souls nor resided in the [[parish]], the work of the incumbent being performed by a [[vicar]]. Such sinecure rectories were expressly granted by the patron. They were abolished by [[parliament]] under the [[Ecclesiastical Commissioners]] Act of 1840.

Other ecclesiastical sinecures were certain [[cathedral]] dignities to which no spiritual functions attached or incumbencies where by reason of depopulation and the like, the parishioners disappeared or the parish church was allowed to decay. Such cases eventually ceased to exist.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. M. Guasco, ''Storia del clero'', Laterza (1997), p.20&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also used of any office or place to which salary emoluments or [[Dignitas (Roman concept)|dignity]] but no duties are attached. The British civil service and the royal household, for example, were loaded with innumerable offices which by lapse of time, had become sinecures and were only kept as the reward of political services or to secure voting power in parliament. They were prevalent in the 18th century, but were gradually abolished by statutes during that and the following centuries.

Below is a list of extant sinecures by Country.&lt;ref&gt;As extracted from Lord Mackay of Clashfern (ed.) (2002) ''Halsbury's Laws of England'', 4th ed. Vol.14.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abu Ja'far Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari''' ({{lang-ar|??? ???? ???? ?? ???? ?? ???? ??????}}) (224 ? 310 AH; 838?923 CE) was a prominent and influential Kharji scholar, historian and [[tafsir|exegete of the Qur'an]] from [[Tabaristan]], modern [[Mazandaran]] in [[Persia]]/[[Iran]].

His most influential and best known works are his Qur'anic commentary known as ''[[Tafsir al-Tabari]]'' and his historical chronicle ''Tarikh al-Rusul wa al-Muluk'' ([[History of the Prophets and Kings]]), often referred to ''Tarikh al-Tabari''. Al-Tabari founded his own [[madhhab]] which is usually designated by the name [[Jariri]].{{Citation needed|date= February 2012}}

==Biography==
Tabari was born in [[Amol]], [[Tabaristan]] (some twenty kilometres south of the [[Caspian Sea]]) in the winter of 838?9.&lt;ref&gt;Franz Rosenthal, trans., ''The History of al-?abar?'' (State University of New York Press, 1989), Volume 1, pp. 10-11&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hafiz (Qur'an)|He memorized the Qur'an]] at seven, was a qualified [[Imam|religious leader]] at eight and began to study the [[hadith|prophetic traditions]] at nine. He left home to study in A.H. 236&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, pp. 15?16&lt;/ref&gt; (850?1) when he was twelve. He retained close ties to his home town. He returned at least twice, the last time in A.H. 290 (903) when his outspokenness caused some uneasiness and led to his quick departure.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

He first went to [[Ray (city)|Ray (Rhages)]], where he remained for some five years.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; A major teacher in Rayy was Abu Abdillah Muhammad ibn Humayd al-Razi, who had earlier taught in Baghdad but was now in his seventies.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Among other material, ibn Humayd taught Jarir Tabari the historical works of [[ibn Ishaq]], especially ''[[Sirah Rasul Allah|al-Sirah]]'', his life of [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Tabari was thus introduced in youth to pre-Islamic and early Islamic history. Tabari quotes ibn Humayd frequently. We know little about Tabari's other teachers in Rayy.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Tabari then travelled to study in Baghdad under [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal|ibn Hanbal]], who, however, had recently died (in late 855 or early 856).&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Tabari possibly made a pilgrimage prior to his first arrival in Baghdad.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; He left Baghdad probably in 242 A.H. (856?7)&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; to travel through the southern cities of [[Basra]], [[Kufah]] and [[Wasit]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; There he met a number of eminent and venerable scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

On his return to Baghdad, he took a tutoring position from the vizier Ubaydallah b. Yahya b. Khaqan.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; This would have been before A.H. 244 (858) since the vizier was out of office and in exile from 244 to 248 (858-9 to 862).&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; There is an anecdote told that Tabari had agreed to tutor for ten dinars a month, but his teaching was so effective and the boy's writing so impressive that the teacher was offered a tray of dinars and dirhams. The ever-ethical Tabari declined the offer saying he had undertaken to do his work at the specified amount and could not honourably take more.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of a number of stories about him declining gifts or giving gifts of equal or greater amount in return.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

In his late twenties he travelled to Syria, Palestine and Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; In Beirut he made the highly significant connection of al-Abbas b. al-Walid b. Mazyad al-'Udhri al-Bayruti (c.169-270/785-6 to 883?4). Al-Abbas instructed Tabari in the Syrian school's variant readings of the Qur'an and transmitted through his father al-Walid the legal views of [[Abd-al-Rahman al-Awzai|al-Awza'i]], Beirut's prominent jurist from a century earlier.{{Citation needed|date= February 2012}}

Tabari arrived in Egypt in 253H (867),&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; and some time after 256/870 returned to Baghdad,&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; possibly making a pilgrimage on the way. If so, he did not stay long in the [[Hijaz]]. Tabari had a private income from his father while he was still living and then the inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; He took money for teaching. He never took a government or a judicial position.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Qur'an Tabari.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Quran Tabari]]
==Personal Characteristics==
He is described as having a dark complexion, large eyes and a long beard. He was tall and slender&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; and his hair and beard remained black until he was very old. He was attentive to his health, avoiding red meat, fats and other unhealthy foods. He was seldom sick before his last decade when he suffered from bouts of pleurisy. When he was ill, he treated himself )to the approval of physicians).{{Citation needed|date= February 2012}} He had a sense of humour, though serious subjects he treated seriously. He had studied poetry when young and enjoyed writing, reciting and participating in poetic exchanges. It is said that he was asked in Egypt about al-Tirimmah and was able to recite this seventh century poet's work for Egyptians who had merely heard al-Tirimmah's name.{{Citation needed|date= February 2012}}

He was witty and urbane, clean and well mannered.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; He avoided coarse speech, instead displaying refined eloquence.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 4o&lt;/ref&gt; He had a good grounding in grammar, lexicography and philology. Such were considered essential for Qur'anic commentary. He knew Persian and was acquainted with the origins of various foreign loan words in Arabic from a number of other languages.

Tabari never married.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; There is a description of his normal day: rising early for prayer, studying till early afternoon, publicly praying the afternoon prayer, reciting Qur'an and teaching Qur'an, and then teaching law until late.{{Citation needed|date= January 2012}}

He died in [[Baghdad]] on February 17, 923.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
&lt;!--No-source image [[Image:1-2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The first volume of the Persian translation of The commentary on the Qur'an]]--&gt;

Al-Tabari wrote [[history]], [[theology]] and [[Qur'an]]ic commentary. His legal writings were published first and then continued to appear throughout his life. Next were his commentaries on the Qur'an. Lastly, his history was published. Despite a style that makes it seem he drew largely on oral sources, written material (both published and unpublished) provided him with the bulk of his information.{{Citation needed|date= February 2012}} His biographers stress his reverence for scholarship and  his keen intent to offer his readers hard fact.

He did not hesitate to express his independent judgement (''[[ijtihad]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; He stated his assessment as to which of the sources he cited was accurate. This was more understandably an aspect of his theology than of his history. This does not mean he saw himself as innovative. On the contrary, he was very much opposed to religious innovation. The story goes that when he was near death ibn Kamil suggested he forgive his enemies. He said he was willing to do so, except for the person who had described him as an innovator.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; In general Tabari's approach was conciliatory and moderate, seeking harmonious agreement between conflicting opinions.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially he identified as a [[Shafi'ite]] in Fiqh law and Shafi'ites were happy to have him so considered. He was later seen {{By whom|date= February 2012}} as having established his own school. Although he had come to Baghdad in youth to study from Hanbal, he incurred the vehement wrath of the [[Hanbalite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Tabari's [[madhhab]] is usually designated by the name [[Jariri]] after his [[patronymic]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the keenly competitive atmosphere of the times, his school failed to endure.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

His wrote extensively; his voluminous corpus containing two main titles:

*'''[[History of the Prophets and Kings (book)|History of the Prophets and Kings]]''' ? (Arabic: ????? ????? ??????? or ''Tarikh al-Rusul wa al-Muluk or Tarikh al-Tabari)

The first of the two large works, generally known as the ''Annals'' (Arabic ''Tarikh al-Tabari''). This is a [[universal history]] from the time of Qur'anic [[Creation myth|Creation]] to [[915|AD 915]], and is renowned for its detail and accuracy concerning [[Muslim]] and [[Middle East]]ern history. Tabari's work is one of the major primary source for historians.

*'''[[The commentary on the Qur'an (book)|The Commentary on the Qur'an]]''' ? (Arabic: ''al-musamma Jami al-bayan fi ta'wil al-Qur'an'', commonly called ''Tafsir al-Tabari'')

His second great work was the commentary on the [[Qur'an]], (Arabic ''Tafsir al-Tabari''), which was marked by the same fullness of detail as the ''Annals''. Abul-Qaasim Ibn 'Aqil Al-Warraq  (???? ????) says: &quot; Im?m Ibn Jarir (???? ????) once said to his students: ?Are you'll ready to write down my lesson on the Tafsir (commentary) of the entire Holy Quran?&quot; They enquired as to how lengthy it would be. &quot;30 000 pages&quot;! he replied. They said: &quot;This would take a long time and cannot be completed in one lifetime. He therefore made it concise and kept it to 3000 pages (note, this was in reference to the old days when they used ink and hard-paper which was a bit long format today). It took him seven years to finish it from the year 283 till 290. It is said {{By whom|date= February 2012}} that it is the most voluminous Athari Tafsir (i.e., based on hadith not intellect) existent today so well-received by the Ummah that it survived to this day intact due to its popularity and widely printed copies available worldwide. Scholars such as [[Baghawi]] and [[Suyuti]] used it largely. It was used in compiling the [[Tafsir ibn Kathir]] which is often referred to as Mukhtasar Tafsir at-Tabari.

*[[Tahdhib al-Athar|'''Tahdh?b al-Ath?r''']] (????? ??????) was begun by Tabari. This was on the traditions transmitted from the [[Sahaba|Companions]] of [[Muhammad]]. It was not, however, completed.

Free and Independent Republic of West Florida

{{Intro missing|date=February 2012}}==Republic of West Florida==
[[File:Bonnieblue.svg|thumb|right|The [[Bonnie Blue Flag]] of the Republic of West Florida.]]
The United States and Spain held long, inconclusive negotiations on the status of West Florida. In the meantime, American settlers established a foothold in the area and resisted Spanish control. British settlers, who had remained, also resented Spanish rule, leading to a [[rebellion]] in 1810 and the establishment for exactly 90 days of the '''Free and Independent Republic of West Florida'''.

On September 23, 1810, after meetings beginning in June, rebels overcame the Spanish garrison at [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] and unfurled the flag of the new republic: a single white star on a blue field. This flag was made by Melissa Johnson, wife of Major Isaac Johnson, the commander of the West Florida Dragoons. It would later become known as the &quot;[[Bonnie Blue Flag]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.freeuk.net/gazkhan/blank_national.htm Confederate National and Bonnie Blue Flags].&lt;/ref&gt;

The boundaries of the Republic of West Florida included all territory south of the 31st parallel, west of the [[Perdido River]], and east of the [[Mississippi River]], but north of [[Lake Pontchartrain]]. The southern boundary was the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. It included [[Baldwin County, Alabama|Baldwin]] and [[Mobile County, Alabama|Mobile]] counties in what is now Alabama; the Mississippi counties of [[Hancock County, Mississippi|Hancock]], [[Pearl River County, Mississippi|Pearl River]], [[Harrison County, Mississippi|Harrison]], [[Stone County, Mississippi|Stone]], [[Jackson County, Mississippi|Jackson]], and [[George County, Mississippi|George]], as well as the southernmost portions of [[Lamar County, Mississippi|Lamar]], [[Forrest County, Mississippi|Forrest]], [[Perry County, Mississippi|Perry]], and [[Wayne County, Mississippi|Wayne]] counties; and the Louisiana [[List of Louisiana parishes|parishes]] of [[East Baton Rouge Parish|East Baton Rouge]], [[East Feliciana Parish|East]] and [[West Feliciana Parish|West Feliciana]], [[Livingston Parish|Livingston]], [[St. Helena Parish|St. Helena]], [[Tangipahoa Parish|Tangipahoa]], [[St. Tammany Parish|St. Tammany]] and [[Washington Parish|Washington]]. Despite its name, none of present-day Florida lay within its borders.  The capital of the Republic of West Florida was [[St. Francisville, Louisiana|St. Francisville]] in present-day Louisiana, on a bluff along the Mississippi River.

The Constitution of West Florida was based largely on the [[Constitution of the United States|United States Constitution]], and divided the government into three branches: executive, judicial, and legislative. The legislature consisted of a Senate and House of Representatives. The Governor was chosen by the legislature. According to the constitution, the official name of the nation was the &quot;State of Florida&quot;. The first and only governor was [[Fulwar Skipwith]], a former American diplomat who had helped negotiate the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. In his inaugural address, Skipwith mentioned the possibility of annexation to the United States:

{{cquote|...wherever the voice of justice and humanity can be heard, our declaration, and our just rights will be respected. But the blood which flows in our veins, like the tributary streams which form and sustain the father of rivers, encircling our delightful country, will return if not impeded, to the heart of our parent country. The genius of [[George Washington|Washington]], the immortal founder of the liberties of America, stimulates that return, and would frown upon our cause, should we attempt to change its course.}}

[[Reuben Kemper]] led a small force in an attempt to capture [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] from the Spanish, but the expedition ended in failure. The marching song of the West Floridian army included the lyrics:

:West Floriday, that lovely nation,
:Free from king and tyranny,
:Thru? the world shall be respected,
:For her true love of Liberty.

==American annexation of the Republic==
{{wikisource|Respecting taking Possession of Part of Louisiana.}}
[[Image:West Florida Map.png|thumb|right|300px|The [[Republic of West Florida]], today divided among three states.]]
On October 27, 1810, the ostensible Republic of West Florida was annexed by [[proclamation]] of [[U.S. President]] [[James Madison]], who claimed the region as part of the Louisiana Purchase. At first, Skipwith and the West Florida government were opposed to the proclamation, preferring to negotiate terms to join the Union. However, [[William C. C. Claiborne]], who was sent to take possession of the territory, refused to recognize the legitimacy of the West Florida government. Skipwith proclaimed that he was ready to &quot;die in defense of the Lone Star flag.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;See inserted &quot;Bonnie Blue Flag&quot; image. The Republic of West Florida was also known as the Lone Star Republic.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Skipwith and the legislature eventually backed down and agreed to accept Madison's proclamation. The incorporation of West Florida into the Orleans district represents the emergence of infant American imperialism by the newly constructed union. Using force, not negotiations, Claiborne and his army, with Madison's proclamation, forced Skipwith and his sympathizers to accept foreign rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scallions|first=Cody|title=The Rise and Fall of the Original Lone Star State: Infant American Imperialism Ascendant in West Florida|journal=The Florida Historical Quarterly|date=Fall|year=2011|volume=90|issue=2|pages=193-220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States took possession of St. Francisville on December 6, 1810, and of [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] on December 10, 1810. These portions were incorporated into the newly formed [[Territory of Orleans]]. The U.S. annexed the [[Mobile District]] of West Florida to the [[Mississippi Territory]] in 1812.

(''chronos'': time), is a [[chronology|chronological]] inconsistency in some arrangement, especially a juxtaposition of person(s), events, objects, or customs from different periods of time. Often the item misplaced in time is an object, but it may be a verbal expression, a technology, a philosophical idea, a musical style, a material, a custom, or anything else associated with a particular period in time so that it is incorrect to place it outside its proper temporal domain.

==Types==
[[File:Cesare Gennari Orfeo.jpg|thumb|right|150 px|[[Orpheus]], of [[Ancient Greece|Classical Greek]] mythology, depicted by [[Cesare Gennari]] with a [[violin]] that did not exist before 16th century]]
The intentional use of older, often obsolete cultural artifacts may be regarded as anachronistic. For example, it could be considered anachronistic for a modern-day person to wear a [[top hat]], write with a [[quill]], or carry on a conversation in Latin. Such choices may reflect an [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentricity]], or an [[aesthetic]] preference.

Another sort of [[parachronism]] arises when a work based on a particular era's state of knowledge is read within the context of a later era with a different state of knowledge. Many scientific works that rely on theories that have later been discredited have become anachronistic with the removal of those underpinnings, and works of [[speculative fiction]] often find their speculation outstripped by real-world technological development.

A ''prochronism'', on the other hand, occurs when an item appears in a temporal context in which it could not yet be present (the object had not yet been developed, the verbal expression had not been coined, the philosophy had not been formulated, the breed of animal had not been developed, the technology had not been created). An example is [[Western (genre)|Western]] movies' placing in frontier society of [[Antebellum era|antebellum]] or [[American Civil War|Civil War]] years, of firearms not introduced until the 1870s, such as the [[Winchester rifle|Winchester 1873 rifle]] or the [[Colt Firearms|Colt]] [[Single Action Army]] revolver. While prochronisms such as this may not be noticed by the uninformed, other prochronisms are intentionally comic, e.g. a 10th century peasant earnestly explaining his village as an &quot;[[anarcho-syndicalist]] [[Commune (intentional community)|commune]]&quot; in the film ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'', or a [[Beatlesque]] band called the &quot;Bedbugs&quot; appearing in the [[American Civil War]] era TV comedy ''[[F-Troop]]'').

==Politically motivated anachronism==
[[Image:Constantin Lecca - Infratirea moldovenilor si muntenilor.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Constantin Lecca]]'s painting &quot;Moldavians and [[Muntenia]]ns become brothers&quot;, showing 19th Century flags in a 16th century scene.]]
Some writings and works of art promoting a political, nationalist or revolutionary cause use an anachronism to depict an institution or custom as being more ancient than it actually is. For example, the 19th century Romanian painter [[Constantin Lecca]] depicted the peace agreement between [[Bogdan III cel Orb|Ioan Bogdan Voievod]] and [[Radu cel Mare|Radu Voievod]] - two leaders in Romania's 16th century history - with the flags of [[Moldavia]] (blue-red) and of [[Wallachia]] (yellow-blue) seen in the background. These flags only date from the 1830s. Anachronism here served to increase legitimacy for the unification of [[Moldavia]] and  [[Wallachia]] into the [[Kingdom of Romania]], at the time the painting was made.

==Artifacts==
An anachronism can be an [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]] which appears out of place [[archaeology|archaeologically]], [[geology|geologically]], or [[time|temporally]]. It is sometimes called OOPArt, for &quot;[[out-of-place artifact]]&quot;. Anachronisms usually appear more technologically advanced than is expected for their place and period.

However, a seeming anachronism may reflect ignorance of history rather than a genuine [[chronology|chronological anomaly]]. A popular view of history presents an unfolding of the past in which humanity has a primitive start and progresses toward development of technology. Allegedly anachronistic artifacts demonstrate contradictions to this idea. Some archaeologists believe that seeing these artifacts as anachronisms underestimates the technology and creativity of people at the time.

==Art and fiction==
Anachronism is used especially in works of imagination that rest on a historical basis. Anachronisms may be introduced in many ways: for example, in the disregard of the different modes of life and thought that characterize different periods, or in ignorance of the progress of the arts and sciences and other facts of history. They vary from glaring inconsistencies to scarcely perceptible misrepresentation. It is only since the close of the 18th century that this kind of deviation from historical reality has jarred on a general audience. Anachronisms abound in the works of [[Raffaello Santi|Raphael]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], as well as in those of less celebrated painters and playwrights of earlier times.
[[File:Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) - The Last Supper (1495-1498).jpg|thumb|right|300px|''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], 1498, depicts [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]], which were brought to Europe by [[Portugal|Portuguese]] traders from [[India]] in the 15th century and were unknown at the time and place of the [[Last Supper]].]]
In particular, the artists, on the stage and on the canvas, in story and in song, assimilated their characters to their own nationality and their own time. Roman soldiers appear in Renaissance military garb. [[The Virgin Mary]] was represented in Italian works with Italian characteristics, and in [[Flanders|Flemish]] works with Flemish ones. [[Alexander the Great]] appeared on the French stage in the full costume of [[Louis XIV of France]] down to the time of [[Voltaire]]; and in England the contemporaries of [[Joseph Addison]] found unremarkable (in [[Alexander Pope|Pope's]] words)
:&quot;[[Cato the Younger|Cato's]] long wig, flower'd gown, and lacquer'd chair.&quot;

Shakespeare's audience similarly did not ask whether the [[University of Wittenberg]] had existed in [[Hamlet]]'s day, or whether clocks that [[striking clock|struck time]] were available in ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'s'' ancient Rome: Shakespeare portrayed [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Brutus]], plotting to assassinate [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] in 44 BC, being interrupted by the striking of the clock,&lt;ref&gt;[http://shakespeare-navigators.com/JC_Navigator/JC_2_1.html#sd15 ''Julius Caesar'', Act 2, Scene 1, Line 192 - &quot;''Clock strikes''&quot;] or [http://shakespeare.mit.edu/julius_caesar/full.html#2.1.199 ''Julius Caesar'', Act 2, Scene 1 - &quot;''Clock strikes''&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;, although [[ancient Rome]] was the era of the [[sundial]], with invention of the [[clock|mechanical clock]] dating from the 11th-13th centuries AD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antique-collectable-clock.com/who-invented-the-clock.html Who invented the clock?]&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Henry Purcell]] wrote the opera &quot;[[Dido and Aeneas]]&quot;, which is based on themes from [[Classical Antiquity]] and is set in the immediate aftermath of the [[Trojan War]]; yet, he provided [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)]] with a sister called &quot;[[Belinda]]&quot; - a name which is probably of Germanic origin and certainly did not exist before the [[Middle Ages]].

However, in many works, such anachronisms are ''not'' simply the result of the artist's ignorance. [[Early Renaissance painting|Renaissance painters]], for example, were well aware of the differences in costume between ancient times and their own, given the renewed attention to ancient art in their time, but they often chose to depict ancient scenes in contemporary garb. Rather, these anachronisms reflect a difference of emphasis compared to the 19th and 20th century attention to depicting details of former times as they actually were. Artists and writers of earlier times were usually more concerned with other aspects of the composition, it was a secondary consideration that the events depicted took place far in the past. They took the view that many details required for historic realism would have been a distraction. (See [[#Accidental and intentional anachronism|Accidental and intentional anachronism]] below)

Authors sometimes telescope [[chronology]] for the sake of making a point. [[Boles?aw Prus]] does this at several junctures in his 1895 [[historical novel]], ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'', set in [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]] in 1087?1085 BC. The ancient &quot;[[Suez Canal#History|Suez Canal]]&quot;, proposed by Prince Hiram (chapter 55),&lt;ref&gt;[[Boles?aw Prus]], ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'', pp. 470-75.&lt;/ref&gt; had existed in [[ancient Egypt]]'s [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], centuries ''before'' the period of the novel. Conversely, the remarkably accurate calculation of the [[Earth#Shape|earth's circumference]] by [[Eratosthenes]], and the invention of a [[steam engine]] by [[Heron of Alexandria|Heron]], both ascribed in chapter 60 to the priest Menes,&lt;ref&gt;[[Boles?aw Prus]], ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'', pp. 543-47.&lt;/ref&gt; historically occurred in [[Ancient Egypt#Ptolemaic dynasty|Alexandrian Egypt]], centuries ''after'' the period of the novel.

In recent times, the progress of archaeological research and the more scientific spirit of history have led audiences and artists to view anachronism as an offense or mistake. Yet modern dramatic productions often rely on anachronism for effect. In particular, directors of Shakespeare's plays may use costumes and props not only of Shakespeare's day or their own, but of any era in between or even those of an imagined future. For instance, the musical ''[[Return to the Forbidden Planet]]'' crosses ''[[The Tempest (play)|The Tempest]]'' with popular music to create a science fiction musical.

A celebrated 1960 stage production of ''[[Hamlet]]'', starring [[Richard Burton]], was set on a bare New York stage in contemporary rehearsal clothes: the audience could have been watching the rehearsal before the dress rehearsal. The point of the staging was apparently that the story of Hamlet is a universal one that was equally credible in the 20th century as in the 17th. {{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

Other popular adaptations of Shakespeare's plays that relied on anachronisms in props and setting were ''[[Titus (film)|Titus]]'' (1999) and ''[[William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet]]'' (1996). A similar approach was used in the 2001 film ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'', in which a diverse selection of 20th century music is used over a [[fin de si?cle]] backdrop. Other films, such as ''[[Brazil (film)|Brazil]]'', ''[[Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events|A Series of Unfortunate Events]]'', or ''[[Richard III (1995 film)|Richard III]]'' may create worlds so full of various conflicting anachronisms as to create a unique stylistic environment that lacks a specific period setting. This type of stylistic anachronism is often used in children's movies, such as ''[[Shrek]]'' and ''[[Hoodwinked]]'', for [[satire|satirical]] effect. (See [[#Comical anachronism|Comical anachronism]] below.)

Sometimes a director may use anachronisms to offer a &quot;fresh&quot; angle on an already established story. Thus [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] created two popular musicals, ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' and ''[[Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat]]'', which filled traditional [[biblical]] stories with modern-day sensibilities; and on a similar note, [[Catherine Hardwicke]]'s ''[[The Nativity Story]]'' shows a field of maize-corn in a Nazareth farming scene. Maize-corn is native to [[Mesoamerica]]; until the late 15th century it was grown only in the Americas.

===Comical anachronism===
[[Comedy]] fiction set in the past may use anachronism for [[humor]]ous effect. One of the first major films to use anachronism was [[Buster Keaton]]'s ''The Three Ages'', which included the invention of [[Stone Age]] [[baseball]] and modern traffic problems in classical [[Rome]].

In [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s 1937 story ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]'' the protagonist - supposedly living before the time of [[King Arthur]] - is depicted using a [[blunderbuss]]. Clearly, Tolkien knew when firearms were invented, but he deliberately set out to write a lighthearted fantasy tale disregarding any consideration of historical accuracy.

[[Mel Brooks]]' 1974 film ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'', set in the [[Wild West]] in 1874, contains many blatant anachronisms from the 1970s, including a stylish [[Gucci]] costume for the sheriff, an [[automobile]], a scene at [[Grauman's Chinese Theater]], and frequent references to [[Hedy Lamarr]] (1914?2000).

The cartoon ''[[The Flintstones]]'' depicts many modern appliances and ideas (such as the automobile) in a prehistoric setting?and depicts a [[dinosaur]] as a household pet. The [[Walt Disney Feature Animation|Disney]] movie ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', in particular, featured many short scenes in which the Genie briefly changed into caricatures of many famous people from all across time, including many 20th century figures and comedians, and quoted lines for comic effect.  Also Disney's Movie Hercules, and its spin-off TV series and TV movie show Ancient Greece with modern day things and places such as restaurants, Hollywood stamps, and others.  The same things are for Disney's the Emperor's New Groove, but this time with the Incan Empire with modern day things such as restaurants, pinatas, floor washers, scientists' labs, rangers, scouts, teddy bears, roller coasters, levers, candles, toasts, and others.  The cartoon TV series, &quot;Time Squad,&quot; with modern-day touches in past eras, and with the Dreamworks SKG movie Shrek and its sequels featuring the Middle Ages with modern day stuff.

Series 3 of ''[[The Micallef Program]]'' included a sketch by the name of 'Billy Anachronism' in which a janitor was sent back to multiple time periods before returning to the 1970s with several items of clothing depicting the places he had been.

[[Peter Greenaway]]'s ''[[The Draughtsman's Contract]]'', set in the 18th century, shows [[pop art]] on the walls of the manor; in the uncut version, it showed a [[cordless telephone]]. The latter scene was removed for issues of audience comprehensibility.

In a sketch in ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', a [[Paperboy|newspaper boy]] yells, &quot;Extra, extra! Newspaper boys are anachronisms in modern day society, read all about it!&quot;.

===Future anachronism===
&lt;!-- This leads to its sub-sub sections below --&gt;
&lt;!-- Section is linked to from the redirect [[Future anachronism]] --&gt;
Anachronisms in stories set in the future can be either unintentional or intentional.

====Unintentional====
Even with careful research, [[science fiction]] writers risk anachronism as their works age. For example, many books and films nominally set in the mid 21st century or later refer to the [[Soviet Union]], defunct in 1991, or refer to [[Saint Petersburg]] in Russia as Leningrad, e.g. in ''[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]]''. Such conflicts can be [[retconned]] by positing a return to the former state, a new Soviet Union emerging and the city's name changing back to Leningrad.

Stories published before the invention of solid state electronics often depict characters in futuristic settings still using vacuum tube radios and slide rules. This is particularly noticeable in [[George O. Smith]]'s [[Venus Equilateral]] stories, written between 1942 and 1945 but set in the mid 21st century, where radio communication using vacuum tubes, though more advanced than the ones at the 1940s, is a major plot subject. Also, the 1887 novel [[Looking Backwards]], set in 2000, features a form of [[alarm clock]]/[[radio]] with vacuum tubes.

[[Clifford Simak]]'s ''Time is the Simplest Thing'' (published in 1961) is set in the 22nd century, a time when cars are equipped with atomic engines and do not touch the ground, [[teleportation]] exists but is not available to the general public, and a means of travel to stars thousands of [[light year]]s distant was created, but telephone calls go through manual [[telephone exchange]]s that have never been automated.

Conversely, some works assumed a more rapid rate of technological advance in the near future than actually happened, e.g. many of the works of [[Ray Bradbury]] depict futuristic families who rely on helicopters as a main mode of travel, which had not occurred by the date stated. The same is true for [[Robert A. Heinlein|Heinlein]]'s ''[[The Puppet Masters]]''.

[[H. Beam Piper]]'s novels, largely set in the 27th century &quot;Atomic Era&quot; (circa 2600) envision anti-gravity drives and [[faster-than-light|super-luminal travel]] but still depict analog tape-based recording. Futuristic films, such as ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', sometimes have anachronisms, e.g. in that film a 1960s [[Volkswagen Beetle]] is run off the road, and listening to [[microcassette]]s in a film set deep in the late 20th century. (Note, however, that in our timeline, a [[Volkswagen New Beetle|modernized version of the Beetle]] was introduced in 1998.)

This can happen another way as well: [[William Gibson]]'s [[Sprawl trilogy]] depicts a [[cyberpunk]] world of fantastically advanced technology in which personal mobile phones do not exist, characters rely extensively on pay phones or exotic satellite-based communication and 8 [[megabytes]] of [[RAM]] is a valuable commodity. ([[Mobile phone]]s already existed at the time of the works, but they were big, clunky, and expensive; Gibson did not foresee their miniaturization and ubiquity.)

A more subtle example may be found in the 1989 film ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'', where it is assumed that fax machines are ubiquitous in 2015, instead of e-mail. Shows like ''[[The Jetsons]]'' also tend to have a number of similar examples, depicting [[Rock_music#Counterculture_movement_.281963.E2.80.931974.29|1960s style rock music]] as still unacceptable to adults, and that media of any kind would still be recorded on tape. This is satirized in the ''[[Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law]]'' episode ''Back to the Present''.

====Intentional====
Anachronisms are sometimes intentionally used in stories about the future. This can function to make the story seem comical or help a contemporary audience to relate to a story set in the future.

The [[television series]] ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'''s vision of a pioneer culture dominant in the outer regions of the galaxy mirrors the mid-West pioneer culture of 19th century [[United States]]. This can be seen as an anachronism, but one which helps an audience to identify with characters and even see the story as allegory, as the creator wanted the story to follow people who had fought on the losing side of a war and their experiences afterwards as pioneers and immigrants on the outskirts of civilization, much like the post-[[American Civil War]] era of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] and the [[American Old West]] culture.

Sometimes terms are intentionally used anachronistically, especially when referring to futuristic technology and the writers prefer to retain audience identification instead of creating a new term that would then have to be explained. The original ''[[Star Trek]]'' series also made reference to &quot;computer tapes&quot; although the storage media seen strongly resembled [[floppy disk]]s, which had not yet been invented in the real world.

One work where nominal anachronisms are present but not fatal to credibility is [[David Brin]]'s 1990 novel ''[[Earth (novel)|Earth]].'' Brin foresees the ubiquity of the computer networks (but not the term ''Internet''), but he was writing in the year before the [[World Wide Web]] was made popular. He therefore refers to documents that are readily available to computer users but called by clumsy numeric identifiers, rather than [[URL]]s. He also imagines that personal [[video recorders]], like [[camcorder]]s, would influence [[civil liberties]] by making it possible for ordinary citizens to film crimes committed by police, as well as by [[hooligan]]s. He does not foresee the ways in which both still photographs and video can be transmitted, making it possible for amateur reporters to cover breaking news stories and get their stories televised.

===Accidental and intentional===
With the detail required for a modern historical movie it is easy to introduce anachronisms.
* The 1995 hit film ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]'' contains numerous errors, including a wrong [[NASA]] logo and the appearance of [[The Beatles]]' ''[[Let It Be (album)|Let It Be]]'' album a month before it was released.
* The film [[Grounding (film)|''Grounding'']], about the collapse of the airline [[Swissair]], is set in September 2001, yet computers are shown using [[Windows XP]], which was released a month later, and some [[Volkswagen Phaeton|VW Phaetons]] are being used, which were released a year later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0449959/goofs|title=Grounding - Die letzten Tage der Swissair (2006) - Goofs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Many movies about [[World War II]] depict [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] being performed, which was rarely described or performed until the late 1950s.
* A scene from the movie ''[[Goodfellas]]'', captioned &quot;[[John F. Kennedy International Airport|Idlewild Airport]] 1963&quot;, shows a [[Boeing 747]] flying over, but the 747 did not make its first flight until 1969. Also, Ray Liotta is seen leaning on a 1965 Impala.
* The film ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' (1997) also contains a well-known anachronism. Jack, one of the main characters in the movie (played by [[Leonardo DiCaprio]]), claims to have gone ice fishing on [[Lake Wissota]], near [[Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin|Chippewa Falls]], [[Wisconsin]]. Lake Wissota is an artificial reservoir that was not created until 1917, five years after the Titanic sank. Rose also pays Jack with a dime that has [[Franklin Roosevelt]]'s picture. Roosevelt did not appear on the dime until 1946. Rose also mentions Austrian psychoanalyst [[Sigmund Freud]]'s ideas on the male preoccupation with size to [[J. Bruce Ismay|Bruce Ismay]]. However, ''Titanic'' is set in 1912, and Freud did not publish the work relating to this until 1920 in ''[[Beyond the Pleasure Principle]]''. Also, up until 1919, Freud relied solely on data from females.
* A series of novels{{Which?|date=December 2011}} set among German soldiers in [[World War II]] describes Russians using [[AK-47]]s, which were invented in 1947, two years after the war ended.
* The movie ''[[Start the Revolution Without Me]]'', which acts in 1750, has a prominent character Christina, a [[Belgium|Belgian]] princess. However, Belgium did not exist until 1830.

Cinematic anachronisms that result from inappropriate objects in a film or television program are common even if they are unintentional. Often, these are faults of costume, especially for a television series filmed with a low budget. Thus, episodes of a 1960s series relating to the frontiersman [[Daniel Boone]] have been shown with 20th century hairdos and clothing with plastic buttons. At times, some modern actor unwilling to put aside a prized wristwatch during a filming of an epic of ancient times is shown with the bulge of the wristwatch under a [[toga]] even if the watch or its band is not partially exposed. A [[ballpoint pen]], a commonplace object of the late 20th century, would not be available until after [[World War II]] to Americans, so any incidence of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], who died during the war, or any earlier [[President of the United States]] signing legislation with one demonstrates an anachronism.

The popular 1970's [[television]] series ''[[The Waltons]]'', set in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] of [[Virginia]] during Franklin Roosevelt's presidency in the [[Great Depression]] and later, [[World War II]], contained several anachronistic references to things that occurred during the pre-war Depression era. The first season is set in 1933,&lt;ref&gt;''The Waltons, Season 1'' DVD set, Episode 18, ''The Courtship''&lt;/ref&gt; yet in the first episode, the family listens to [[Edgar Bergen|Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy's]] radio show,&lt;ref name=foundling&gt;''The Waltons, Season 1'' DVD set, Episode 1, ''The Foundling''&lt;/ref&gt; which did not start until 1937. In the fifth episode, breaking news of an [[1933 Long Beach earthquake|earthquake in Long Beach, California]] is discussed,&lt;ref&gt;''The Waltons, Season 1'', Episode 5, ''The Typewriter''&lt;/ref&gt; though it actually occurred on March 10, 1933 (just six days into Roosevelt's presidency).

A number of accidental anachronisms occur in [[Franc Roddam]]'s 1979 film ''[[Quadrophenia (film)|Quadrophenia]]''. Based on [[Pete Townshend]] and [[The Who]]'s [[Quadrophenia|1973 double album]] about a troubled London teenager trying to fit into the hedonistic early 1960s [[Mod (subculture)|Mod]] scene, the film is widely believed to be set in 1964, as it depicts the [[Mods and Rockers]] seaside battle on [[Brighton]] beach and shows Jimmy's newspaper cuttings of similar battles at Hastings and Margate that same year. The numerous mirrors, lamps and chromed frames adorning Jimmy's [[Lambretta]] scooter also suggest 1964 rather than the stripped-down scooters of later years. However, 1970s car models are seen in street scenes, such as the [[Austin Allegro]]. At a house party, the sleeve of Who LP ''[[A Quick One]]'' is on the top of the record player, yet it was not released until the end of 1966. Also, in a scene on Brighton promenade, a cinema is advertising ''[[Heaven Can Wait (1978 film)|Heaven Can Wait]]'', a film not made until 1978. Furthermore, while Jimmy is watching an episode of ''[[Ready Steady Go!]]'' on TV in 1964 (a pop-music programme aired 1963-66), The Who appear, singing &quot;[[Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere]]&quot;, a song not released until May 1965.

Sometimes movie anachronisms are intentional but appear accidental. An example is the musical score of ''[[The Sting]]''. The [[ragtime]] piano music by [[Scott Joplin]] was composed in the 1890s and 20th century, while the setting of the movie was the 1930s [[Great Depression]]. Although Joplin's music is not contemporary with the 1930s, its use in ''The Sting'' evokes a 1930s gangster film, ''[[The Public Enemy]]'', which had also used Joplin theme music. The presence of Joplin's music might give the impression that the movie's backdrop and music are from the same period or, conversely, be mistaken as an unintentional anachronism by viewers unaware of the allusion to the earlier film.

Technical advances can also cause anachronisms, especially in movies set in the future. Numerous examples of this can be seen in the 1995 film ''[[Harrison Bergeron (film)|Harrison Bergeron]]'', set in 2081. Throughout the film, numerous analog CRT television sets are visible, along with other anachronisms, such as the analog nature and hardware-level programming of handicapping headbands. (One would expect the headbands to be programmable using a computer, as opposed to adjusting by hand.) In a large number of Yugoslavian movies about World War II, 1960s FAP and Tam trucks were used. A 1940 Ford fire truck was used in the 1967 movie ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]''; the [[Bonnie and Clyde|real-life outlaws]] had been killed in 1934.

Anachronisms can show up when filming [[filming location|on location]] since buildings or natural features may be present that would not have been at the time the film was set. For example, many movies are set in the future but show the [[World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]], such as ''[[Vanilla Sky]]''. Some buildings or natural features may be missing in the film but existed at the time the movie was set. Another example is the Coen brothers movie ''[[No Country for Old Men (film)|No Country for Old Men]]'', set in early 1980s Texas, in which a modern-day [[Carl's Jr.]] is visible in the background. The chain did not open its first Texas locations until later in that decade, and did not use its current markings until the 2000s. Similar anachronisms are noticeable in the film ''[[The Blue Max]]'', in which outdoor television antennas are visible on buildings, during scenes set in 1918.

In the [[BBC]] science-fiction sitcom ''[[Red Dwarf]]'', set on a 23rd century spacecraft, Sony [[Trinitron]] monitors are seen throughout the ship and [[VHS]] and [[Betamax]] video cassettes are still in use. One of these unintentional anachronisms is used for comic effect in ''[[Red Dwarf: Back to Earth]]'', when it was explained that [[DVD]]s were discontinued sometime in the late 21st century because &quot;humans were utterly incapable of putting them back in the cases&quot; and that &quot;videos are too big to lose&quot;.

In the case of films made in the past but set in the future, a building or feature may be seen that is known to exist no longer. Especially with regards to historical items and vehicles, anachronisms can stem from convenience; for example, a historically accurate item might be replaced with a later but fairly similar item, especially if a historically accurate item cannot be sourced. In the case of replicas, signs of modern construction techniques may be visible. In some cases, though, due to technological entrenchment, anachronisms cannot be helped, such as in the British television show ''[[Life on Mars (TV series)|Life on Mars]]'' (set in the 1970s), where it would require an excessive amount of work to remove today's outdoor amenities such as park benches or satellite dishes.

===Language anachronism===
[[Language]] anachronisms in novels and films are quite common. They can be intentional or unintentional. Intentional anachronisms let us understand more readily a film set in the past. Language and pronunciation change so fast that most modern people (even many scholars) would have difficulty understanding a film with dialogue in 17th century English; thus, we willingly accept characters speaking an updated language. Similarly, modern [[slang]] and figures of speech are often used in these films. Modern audiences want to understand [[George Washington]] when he speaks, but if he starts talking about &quot;the bottom line&quot; (a [[figure of speech]] that did not come into popular use until almost two centuries after Washington's time) that can stretch credulity and distract the audience.

A character in e.g. Ancient Rome may use what many people will assume to be an ordinary figure of speech, but which a significant minority will be aware is actually a quote from Shakespeare, or the King James Bible, or even Lenin: e.g. the Empress Livia referred to the &quot;infantile disorder of republicanism&quot; in the TV series ''[[I, Claudius]]''.

At the most blatant, linguistic anachronisms can demonstrate the fraudulence of a document purportedly from an earlier time. The use of 19th- and 20th-century [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] terminology demonstrates that the supposed &quot;[[Franklin Prophecy]]&quot; is a forgery, as [[Benjamin Franklin]] died in 1790.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adl.org/special_reports/franklin_prophecy/print.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

==In academia==
Anachronism in academic writing is considered at best embarrassing, as in early 20th century scholarship's use of [[Translatio imperii]] to interpret 10th century literature, when it was first formulated in the 12th century. Genuine errors will usually be acknowledged in a subsequent [[erratum]].

The use in a hyperbolic sense is more complex: to refer to the [[Holy Roman Empire]] as the First [[Reich]], for example, is inaccurate but may be a useful comparative exercise; the application of theory to works which predate [[Marxist]], [[Feminist]] or [[Freudian]] subjectivities is considered an essential part of theoretical practice. In most cases, however, the practitioner will acknowledge or justify the use or context.

'''Rome''' ({{IPA-en|?ro?m}}; {{lang-it|Roma}} {{IPA-it|?ro?ma|pron|It-Roma.ogg}}; {{lang-la|R?ma}}) is a city and special ''[[comune]]'' (&quot;Roma Capitale&quot;) in [[Italy]]. Rome is the capital of [[Italy]], the capital of [[Lazio]] (Latin: ''[[Latium]]'') and the principal town of the [[Province of Rome]]. With over 2.7&amp;nbsp;million residents in {{convert|1285.3|km2|mi2|1|abbr=on}}, it is also the country's largest and most populated city and ''comune''. The city is located in the central-western portion of the [[Italian Peninsula]], on the [[Tiber River]] within the Lazio [[Regions of Italy|region of Italy]].

[[History of Rome|Rome's history]] spans [[List of cities by time of continuous habitation|two and a half thousand years]]. It was the capital city of the [[Roman Kingdom]], the [[Roman Republic]] and the [[Roman Empire]], which was the dominant power in [[Western Europe]] and the lands bordering the Mediterranean for over seven hundred years from the 1st century BC until the 7th century AD and the city is regarded as one of the birthplaces of western civilization. Since the 1st century AD Rome has been the seat of the [[Pope|Papacy]] and, after the end of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] domination, in the 8th century it became the capital of the [[Papal States]], which lasted until 1870. In 1871 Rome became the capital of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861?1946)|Kingdom of Italy]], and in 1946 that of the Italian Republic.

After the [[Middle Ages]], Rome was ruled by popes such as [[Pope Alexander VI|Alexander VI]] and [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]], who transformed the city into one of the major centers of the [[Italian Renaissance]], along with [[Florence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Rome, city, Italy|encyclopedia=Columbia Encyclopedia|edition=6th|year=2009|url=http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=117042793}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current version of [[St. Peter's Basilica|St Peter's Basilica]] was built and the [[Sistine Chapel]] was painted by [[Michelangelo]]. Famous artists and architects, such as [[Donato Bramante|Bramante]], [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]] and [[Raphael]] resided for some time in Rome, contributing to its [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] architecture.

Rome has been ranked by [[GaWC]] in 2010 as a [[world city|beta+ world city]],&lt;ref name=&quot;lboro.ac.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2010t.html |title=GaWC ?

==Etymology==

About the origin of the name ''Roma'' several hypotheses have been advanced.&lt;ref&gt;Claudio Rendina, ''Roma ieri, oggi, domani'', Newton Compton, Roma, 2007, pg. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The most important are the following:
*from ''Rommylos'' ([[Romulus]]), son of [[Ascanius]] and founder of the city;
*from ''Rumon'' or ''Rumen'', archaic name of the [[Tiber]]. It has the same root of the Greek verb ??? (rh?o) and of the Latin verb ''ruo'', which both mean &quot;flow&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;This hypothesis originates from the Roman Grammarian [[Maurus Servius Honoratus]].&lt;/ref&gt;
*from the [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] word ''ruma'', whose root is *rum- &quot;teat&quot;, with possible reference either to the [[Founding of Rome#The legend|totem wolf that adopted and suckled the cognately named twins Romulus and Remus]], or to the shape of the [[Palatine]] and [[Aventine Hill]]s;
*from the Greek word ???? (rh?me), which means ''strength'';&lt;ref&gt;This hypothesis originates from [[Plutarch]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Rome|Timeline of Rome history}}

===Earliest history===
{{Main|Founding of Rome}}
There is archaeological evidence of human occupation of the Rome area from at least 14,000 years ago, but the dense layer of much younger debris obscures Palaeolithic and Neolithic sites.&lt;ref&gt;Heiken, G., Funiciello, R. and De Rita, D. (2005), The Seven Hills of Rome: A Geological Tour of the Eternal City. Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of stone tools, pottery and stone weapons attest to at least 10,000 years of human presence. However, the power of the well known tale of Rome's legendary foundation tends to deflect attention from its actual, and much more ancient, origins.

====Founding of Rome====
The founding of Rome can be investigated through [[classical archaeology|archaeology]], but traditional stories handed down by the [[ancient Romans]] themselves explain the earliest [[History of Rome|history of their city]] in terms of [[legend]] and [[myth]]. The most familiar of these myths, and perhaps the most famous of all [[Roman mythology|Roman myths]], is the story of [[Romulus and Remus]], the twins who were suckled by a [[wolf|she-wolf]].&lt;ref name=&quot;livy1797&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Roman tradition, the city was founded by [[Romulus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'' I, 7&lt;/ref&gt; on 21 April 753 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;lonely planet&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Rome: Pre-20th-Century History|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/worldguide/italy/rome/history|work=[[Lonely Planet]]|accessdate=4 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legendary origin of the city tells that Romulus and Remus decided to build a city. After an argument, Romulus killed his brother Remus. The Roman poet Virgil refers to this belief when he depicts Aeneas as escaping the fall of Troy by coming to Latium to found a line descending to Romulus, first king of Rome. Archaeological evidence supports the view that Rome grew from [[pastoralism|pastoral]] settlements on the [[Palatine Hill]] built in the area of the future [[Roman Forum]]. While some archaeologists argue that Rome was indeed founded in the middle of the 8th century BC, the date is subject to controversy.&lt;ref name=&quot;foundation&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/12/science/12rome.html |title=More Clues in the Legend (or Is It Fact?) of Romulus |first=John Nobel |last=Wilford |date=12 June 2007 |work=New York Times |accessdate=11 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original settlement developed into the capital of the [[Roman Kingdom]] (ruled by a succession of seven kings, according to tradition), and then the [[Roman Republic]] (from 510 BC, governed by the [[Roman Senate|Senate]]), and finally the [[Roman Empire]] (from 27 BC, ruled by an [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]]). This success depended on military conquest, commercial predominance, as well as selective assimilation of neighbouring civilisations, most notably the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]]. From its foundation Rome, although losing occasional battles, had been undefeated in war until 386 BC, when it was briefly occupied by the [[Gauls]].&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''Ab Urbe Condita'' V.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the legend, the Gauls offered to deliver Rome back to its people for a thousand pounds of gold, but the Romans refused, preferring to take back their city by force of arms rather than ever admitting defeat, after which the Romans recovered the city in the same year.

[[File:Roma Plan.jpg|thumb|Map depicting late ancient Rome.]]

The Republic was wealthy, powerful and stable before it became an empire. According to tradition, Rome became a republic in [[509?500 BC|509 BC]]. However, it took a few centuries for Rome to become the great city of popular imagination, and it only became a great empire after the rule of [[Augustus]] (Octavian). By the 3rd century BC, Rome had become the pre-eminent city of the Italian peninsula, having conquered and defeated the [[Sabines]], the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]], the [[Samnite Wars|Samnites]] and most of the Greek colonies in [[Sicily]], Campania and [[Southern Italy]] in general. During the [[Punic Wars]] between Rome and the great Mediterranean empire of [[Carthage]], Rome's stature increased further as it became the capital of an overseas empire for the first time. Beginning in the 2nd century BC, Rome went through a significant population expansion as Italian farmers, driven from their ancestral farmlands by the advent of massive, slave-operated farms called [[latifundium|latifundia]], flocked to the city in great numbers. The victory over Carthage in the [[First Punic War]] brought the first two provinces outside the Italian peninsula, [[Sicily]] and [[Corsica et Sardinia]]. Parts of Spain ([[Hispania]]) followed, and in the beginning of the 2nd century the Romans got involved in the affairs of the Greek world. By then all Hellenistic kingdoms and the Greek city-states were in decline, exhausted from endless civil wars and relying on mercenary troops. This saw the fall of Greece after the [[Battle of Corinth (146 BC)]] and the establishment of Roman control over Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=CosmoLearning |url=http://www.cosmolearning.com/topics/greece-3650-bc-146-bc/ |title=Greco-Roman World ?

The Roman Empire had begun more formally when Emperor Augustus (63 BC?AD 14; known as Octavian before his throne accession) founded the [[Principate]] in 27 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/augustus.shtml |work=Historical Figures |title=Augustus (63 BC ?

The city became dotted with impressive and magnificent new buildings, palaces, [[Forum (Roman)|fora]] and [[basilica]]e. Augustus became a great and enlightened patron of the [[The arts|arts]], and his court was attended by such poets as [[Virgil]], [[Horace]] and [[Sextus Propertius|Propertius]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.co.uk&quot;/&gt; His rule also established the [[Pax Romana]], a long period of relative peace which lasted approximately 200 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unrv.com/early-empire/pax-romana.php |title=Pax Romana |publisher=Unrv.com |accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his rule were emperors such as [[Caligula]], [[Nero]], [[Trajan]], and [[Hadrian]], to name a few. Roman emperor [[Nero]] was well known for his extravagance, cruelty, tyranny, and the myth that he was the emperor who &quot;fiddled while [[Great Fire of Rome|Rome burned]]&quot; during the night of 18 to 19 July 64 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/journals/CJ/42/4/Nero_Fiddled*.html |title=University of Chicago |publisher=Penelope.uchicago.edu |accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Antonine Plague]] of 165?180 is believed to have killed as much as one-third of the population.&lt;ref&gt;Horst R.

Roman dominance expanded over most of Western Europe and the shores of the Mediterranean, though its influence through client states and the sheer power of its presence was wider than its formal borders.

A review of the book ''Population Crises and Population cycles'' by Claire Russell and W.M.S. Russell.&lt;/ref&gt; For almost seven hundred years, Rome was the most politically important, richest, and largest city in the Western world. After the Empire started to [[Decline of the Roman Empire|decline]] and was split, it lost its capital status to [[Milan]] and then to [[Ravenna]], and was surpassed in prestige by the capital of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], [[Constantinople]], whose Greek inhabitants continued through the centuries to call themselves Roman.

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Eroberung roms 410.jpg|thumb|upright|15th century miniature depicting the [[Sack of Rome (410)]]]]

The Bishop of Rome became the Pope due to his increased political and religious importance under Emperor [[Constantine I]]. The Pope set Rome as the centre of the Catholic Church. After the [[Sack of Rome (410)|Sack of Rome in 410 AD]] by [[Alaric I]] and the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|fall of the Western Roman Empire]] in 476 AD, Rome alternated between [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Germania|Germanic]] control. Its population declined from more than a million in 210 AD to a mere 35,000 during the [[Early Middle Ages]],&lt;ref&gt;Luc-Normand Tellier (2009). &quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=cXuCjDbxC1YC&amp;pg=PA185&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Urban world history: an economic and geographical perspective]''&quot;. PUQ. p.185. ISBN 2760515885&lt;/ref&gt; reducing the sprawling city to groups of inhabited buildings interspersed among large areas of ruins and vegetation. Rome remained nominally part of the [[Byzantine Empire]] until 751 AD, when the [[Lombards]] finally extinguished the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]] which was the last holdout of the Byzantines in northern Italy. In 756, [[Pepin the Short]] gave the Pope temporal jurisdiction over Rome and surrounding areas, thus creating the [[Papal States]]. In 846, Muslim Arabs [[Sack of Rome (846)|invaded Rome]] and looted [[Old St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's Basilica]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/06/eust/ht06eust.htm Italian Peninsula, 500?1000 A.D.], [[Metropolitan Museum of Art|The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rome remained the capital of the Papal States until its annexation by the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861?1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] in 1870; the city became a major pilgrimage site during the [[Middle Ages]] and the focus of struggles between the Papacy and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] starting with [[Charlemagne]], who was crowned its first emperor in Rome in 800 by [[Pope Leo III]]. Apart from brief periods as an independent city during the [[Middle Ages]], Rome kept its status as Papal capital and &quot;holy city&quot; for centuries, even when the Papacy [[Avignon papacy|briefly relocated]] to [[Avignon]] (1309?1377).

===Early modern===
{{Main|Roman Renaissance}}
The latter half of the 15th century saw the seat of the [[Italian Renaissance]] move to Rome from [[Florence]]. The Papacy wanted to equal and surpass the grandeur of other Italian cities and to this end created ever more extravagant churches, bridges, town squares and public spaces, including a new [[St. Peter's Basilica|Saint Peter's Basilica]], the [[Sistine Chapel]], ''[[Ponte Sisto]]'' (the first bridge to be built across the [[Tiber River|Tiber]] since antiquity), and [[Piazza Navona]]. The Popes were also patrons of the arts engaging such artists as [[Michelangelo]], [[Pietro Perugino|Perugino]], [[Raphael]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]], [[Luca Signorelli]], [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]], and [[Cosimo Rosselli]].
[[File:Roma-tempiettobramante01R.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The ''Tempietto'' ([[San Pietro in Montorio]]), which is an excellent example of [[Italian Renaissance]] architecture]]

The period was also infamous for papal corruption, with many Popes fathering children, and engaging in [[nepotism]] and [[simony]]. The corruption of the Popes and the extravagance of their building projects led, in part, to the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and, in turn, the [[Counter-Reformation]]. Popes, such as [[Pope Alexander VI|Alexander VI]], were well known for their decadence, wild parties, extravagance and immoral lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/159/000092880/ |title=Pope Alexander VI |publisher=Nndb.com |accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, under these extravagant and rich popes, Rome was transformed into a centre of art, poetry, music, literature, education and culture. Rome became able to compete with other major European cities of the time in terms of wealth, grandeur, the arts, learning and architecture.

[[File:1652 Merian Panoramic View or Map of Rome, Italy - Geographicus - Roma-merian-1642.jpg|right|thumb|Rome in 1642]]
The [[Renaissance]] period changed Rome's face dramatically, with works like the [[Piet? (Michelangelo)|Piet?]] by Michelangelo and the frescoes of the Borgia Apartment, all made during Innocent's reign. Rome reached the highest point of splendour under [[Pope Julius II]] (1503?1513) and his successors [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] and [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]], both members of the [[House of Medici|Medici family]]. In this twenty-year period Rome became one of the greatest centres of art in the world. The old [[St. Peter's Basilica]] built by Emperor [[Constantine the Great]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13369b.htm |work=Catholic Encyclopedia |title=Basilica of St. Peter |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 February 1912 |accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which by then was in a terrible state) was demolished and a new one begun. The city hosted artists like [[Ridolfo Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]], [[Pietro Perugino|Perugino]], [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]] and [[Donato Bramante|Bramante]], who built the temple of [[San Pietro in Montorio]] and planned a great project to renovate the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]]. Raphael, who in Rome became one the most famous painters of Italy creating frescos in the [[Villa Farnesina]], the [[Raphael Rooms|Raphael's Rooms]], plus many other famous paintings. Michelangelo started the decoration of the ceiling of the [[Sistine Chapel]] and executed the famous statue of the [[Moses]] for the tomb of Julius. Rome lost in part its religious character, becoming increasingly a true Renaissance city, with a great number of popular feasts, horse races, parties, intrigues and licentious episodes. Its economy was rich, with the presence of several Tuscan bankers, including [[Agostino Chigi]], who was a friend of Raphael and a patron of arts. Before his early death, Raphael also promoted for the first time the preservation of the ancient ruins. The fight between France and Spain in Europe caused the first plunder of the City in more than one thousand years. In 1527 the [[Landsknecht]]s of Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sacked the city]], putting to an abrupt end the golden age of the Renaissance in Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;CTI, Guida d pg. 22&quot;&gt;CTI, Guida d'Italia, Vol. IV, pg. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with the Council of Trent in 1545, the Church began the Counter-Reformation as an answer to the Reformation, a large-scale questioning of the Church's authority on spiritual matters and governmental affairs. (This loss of confidence then lead to major shifts of power away from the Church.) &lt;ref name=&quot;CTI, Guida d pg. 22&quot;/&gt; Under the popes from [[Pius IV]] to [[Sixtus V]], Rome became the center of the reformed Catholicism and saw the installment of new monuments which celebrated the papacy's restored greatness.&lt;ref&gt;CTI, Guida d'Italia, Vol. IV, pg. 23&lt;/ref&gt; The popes and cardinals of the 17th and early 18th centuries continued the movement by having city's landscape enriched with [[baroque]] buildings. During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], new ideas reached also the Eternal City, where the papacy supported archeological studies and improved the people's welfare.&lt;ref name=&quot;CTI, Guida d pg. 22&quot;/&gt; But not everything went well for the Church during the Counter-Reformation.

There were setbacks in the attempts to restrain the anti-Church policies of European powers of the time. The most notable setback perhaps being in 1773 when Pope Clement XIV was forced by secular powers to have the Jesuit order suppressed.&lt;ref name=&quot;CTI, Guida d pg. 22&quot;/&gt;

The rule of the Popes was interrupted by the short-lived [[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]] (1798), which was built under the influence of the [[French Revolution]]. During [[Napoleon]]'s reign, Rome was annexed into the [[First French Empire|French Empire]]. After the fall of Napoleon, the Church State under the pope was reinstated through the [[Congress of Vienna]] of 1814. In 1849, another [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] arose within the framework of [[revolutions of 1848]]. Two of the most influential figures of the [[Italian unification]], [[Giuseppe Mazzini]] and [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], fought for the short-lived republic.

Rome became the focus of hopes of Italian reunification when the rest of Italy was reunited under the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861?1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] with a temporary capital at [[Florence]]. In 1861, Rome was declared the capital of Italy even though it was still under the control of the Pope. During the 1860s, the last vestiges of the [[Papal States]] were under the French protection, thanks to the foreign policy of [[Napoleon III]]. And it was only when this was lifted in 1870, owing to the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]], that Italian troops were able to [[Capture of Rome|capture Rome]] entering the city through a breach near [[Porta Pia]]. Afterwards, [[Pope Pius IX]] declared himself as [[prisoner in the Vatican]], and in 1871 the capital of Italy was moved from [[Florence]] to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12134b.htm |work=Catholic Encyclopedia |title=Pope Pius IX |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after World War I, Rome witnessed the rise to power of [[Italian Fascism]] guided by [[Benito Mussolini]], who [[March on Rome|marched]] on the city in 1922, eventually declaring a new [[Italian Colonial Empire|Empire]] and allying Italy with [[Nazi Germany]]. The interwar period saw a rapid growth in the city's population, that surpassed 1,000,000 inhabitants. In World War II, due to its status of an [[open city]], Rome [[Bombing of Rome in World War II|largely escaped]] the tragic destiny of other European cities, but was occupied by the Germans from the [[Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces|Italian Armistice]] until [[Liberation of Rome#Breakout|its liberation on 4 June 1944]]. However, on 19 June 1943 Rome was [[Bombing of Rome in World War II|bombed]] by Anglo-American forces, being one of the hardest hit areas in the San Lorenzo district, resulting in about 3,000 deaths and 11,000 wounded.

Rome grew momentously after the war, as one of the driving forces behind the &quot;[[Italian economic miracle]]&quot; of post-war reconstruction and modernisation. It became a fashionable city in the 1950s and early 1960s, the years of &quot;la dolce vita&quot; (&quot;the sweet life&quot;), with popular classic fims such as ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben Hur]]'', ''[[Quo Vadis (1951 film)|Quo Vadis]]'', ''[[Roman Holiday]]'' and ''[[La Dolce Vita]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053779/ IMDb.com]&lt;/ref&gt; being filmed in the city's iconic [[Cinecitt?]] Studios. A new rising trend in population continued until the mid-1980s, when the ''comune'' had more than 2,800,000 residents; after that, population started to slowly decline as more residents moved to nearby suburbs.

[[File:Piazza del Campidoglio.jpg|thumb|[[Palazzo Senatorio]], Rome City Hall]]

Rome constitutes a ''[[comune|comune speciale]]'', named ''&quot;Roma Capitale&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.comune.roma.it/wps/portal/pcr?contentId=NEW151061&amp;jp_pagecode=newsview.wp&amp;ahew=contentId:jp_pagecode|title=Roma diventa Capitale|accessdate=6 March 2012|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and is the largest both in terms of land area and population among the 8,101 ''comuni'' of Italy. It is governed by a mayor, currently [[Gianni Alemanno]], and a city council. The seat of the ''comune'' is the ''Palazzo Senatorio'' on the [[Capitoline Hill]], the historic seat of the city government. The local administration in Rome is commonly referred to as ''&quot;Campidoglio&quot;'', the Italian name of the hill.

====Administrative and historical subdivisions====
[[File:Rome - Overview numbered.PNG|thumb|left|The 19 ''municipi'' of Rome.]]
Since 1972 the city has been divided into 19 (originally 20) &lt;ref&gt;In 1992 after a [[referendum]] the XIX Circoscrizione became the ''[[Comune]]'' of [[Fiumicino]]&lt;/ref&gt; administrative areas, called ''municipi''  (sing. ''municipio'') (until 2001 named ''circoscrizioni''). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Territorio |publisher=Comune di Roma |accessdate=5 October 2009 |url=http://www.comune.roma.it/was/wps/portal/!ut/p/_s.7_0_A/7_0_21L?menuPage=/Area_di_navigazione/Sezioni_del_portale/Dipartimenti_e_altri_uffici/Dipartimento_XV/www-9-romastatistica-9-it/Territorio/&amp;flagSub=|language=Italian}}{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were created for administrative reasons to increase decentralisation in the city. Each ''municipio'' is governed by a president and a council of four members who are elected by its residents every five years. The ''municipi'' frequently cross the boundaries of the traditional, non-administrative divisions of the city.

Rome is also divided into differing types of non-administrative units. The historic centre is divided into 22 ''[[Rioni of Rome|rioni]]'', all of which are located within the [[Aurelian Walls]] except [[Prati]] and [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]].

These originate from the [[14 regions of Augustan Rome|Regiones of ancient Rome]], which evolved in the Middle Ages into the [[14 regions of Medieval Rome|medieval rioni]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.romeartlover.it/Rioni.html |title=The &quot;Rioni&quot; of Rome |publisher=Romeartlover.it |accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Renaissance]], under Pope [[Sixtus V]], they reached again the number of fourteen, and their boundaries were finally defined under [[Pope Benedict XIV]] in 1743.

A new subdivision of the city under [[Napoleon]] was ephemeral, and there were no sensible changes in the organisation of the city until 1870, when Rome became the third capital of Italy. The needs of the new capital led to an explosion both in the urbanisation and in the population within and outside the [[Aurelian Walls|Aurelian walls]]. In 1874 a fifteenth rione, [[Esquilino (rione of Rome)|Esquilino]], was created on the newly urbanised zone of [[Monti (rione of Rome)|Monti]]. At the beginning of the 20th century other rioni where created (the last one was Prati ? the only one outside the Walls of [[Pope Urban VIII]] ? in 1921). Afterward, for the new administrative subdivisions of the city the name &quot;quartiere&quot; was used. Today all the rioni, except Borgo and Prati, are part of the first Municipio, which therefore coincides almost completely with the ''historical city'' (''Centro Storico'').

===Provincial and regional government===
Rome is the principal town of the [[Province of Rome|homonymous Province]], which includes the city's metropolitan area and extends further north until [[Civitavecchia]].  The Province of Rome is the 9th largest by area in Italy. At {{convert|5352|km?}}, its dimensions are comparable to the region of [[Liguria]]. Moreover, the city is also the capital of the [[Lazio]] region.

===National government===
Rome is the national capital of Italy and is the seat of the [[Politics of Italy|Italian Government]]. The official residences of the [[President of Italy|President of the Italian Republic]] and the [[Prime Minister of Italy|Italian Prime Minister]], the seats of both houses of the [[Parliament of Italy|Italian Parliament]] and that of the [[Constitutional Court of Italy|Italian Constitutional Court]] are located in the historic centre. The state ministries are spread out around the city; these include the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is located in [[Palazzo della Farnesina]] near the Olympic stadium.

==Geography==
[[File:Rome, Italy.JPG|thumb|Astronaut View of Rome]]

===Location===
Rome is in the [[Lazio]] region of [[central Italy]] on the [[Tiber River|Tiber]] river ({{lang-it|Tevere}}). The original settlement developed on hills that faced onto a ford beside the [[Tiber Island]], the only natural ford of the river in this area. The Rome of the Kings was built on seven hills: the [[Aventine Hill]], the [[Caelian Hill]], the [[Capitoline Hill]], the [[Esquiline Hill]], the [[Palatine Hill]], the [[Quirinal Hill]], and the [[Viminal Hill]]. Modern Rome is also crossed by another river the [[Aniene]] which flows into the Tiber north of the historic centre.

Although the city center is about {{convert|24|km|mi|0}} inland from the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]], the city territory extends to the shore, where the south-western district of [[Ostia (Rome)|Ostia]] is located. The altitude of the central part of Rome ranges from {{convert|13|m|0}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]] (at the base of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]]) to {{convert|139|m|0}} above sea level (the peak of [[Monte Mario]]).&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Comune'' of Rome covers an overall area of about {{convert|1285|km2|0}}, including many green areas.

===Topography===
[[File:Rome L7 8 3 2001 lrg.jpg|thumb|Rome seen from satellite.]]

Throughout the history of Rome, the urban limits of the city were considered to be the area within the city walls. Originally, these consisted of the [[Servian Wall]], which was built twelve years after the [[Gaul]]ish sack of the city in 390 BC. This contained most of the Esquiline and Caelian hills, as well as the whole of the other five. Rome outgrew the [[Servian Wall]], but no more walls were constructed until almost 700 years later, when, in 270 AD, Emperor [[Aurelian]] began building the [[Aurelian Walls]]. These were almost {{convert |19|km|0}} long, and were still the walls the troops of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861?1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] had to breach to enter the city in 1870. Modern Romans frequently consider the city's urban area to be delimited by its ring-road, the ''[[Grande Raccordo Anulare]]'', which circles the city centre at a distance of about 10&amp;nbsp;km.

The ''Comune'' of Rome, however, covers considerably more territory and extends to the sea at [[Ostia (Rome)|Ostia]], the largest town in Italy that is not a ''comune'' in its own right. The ''comune'' covers an area roughly three times the total area within the ''Raccordo'' and is comparable in area to the entire provinces of [[Milan]] and [[Naples]], and to an area six times the size of the territory of these cities. It also includes considerable areas of abandoned marsh land which is suitable neither for agriculture nor for urban development.

As a consequence, the density of the ''comune'' is not that high, its territory being divided between highly urbanised areas and areas designated as parks, nature reserves, and for agricultural use.

==Climate==

Rome enjoys a [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[K?ppen climate classification]]: ''Csa''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/
|title=World Map of K?ppen?Geiger Climate Classification}}&lt;/ref&gt; typical of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coasts of Italy. Spring and autumn are mild to warm, and the Romans ''ottobrate'' (&quot;beautiful October days&quot;) are known as being sunny and warm. By August, the maximum diurnal temperature often exceeds {{convert|30|?C}}. Traditionally, many businesses were accustomed to closing during August, while Romans visited holiday resorts. In more recent years, however, in response to growing tourism and changing work habits, the city has been staying open for the whole summer. The average high temperature in January is about {{convert|12.9|?C|1}}, but in hot periods it can be higher, while subzero lows are not uncommon. Snowfalls can occur in the winter months, but are rare. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meteo-net.it/articoli/storiconeve.aspx|title=Storia della neve a Roma|accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Generally ? summer's season lasts about 6 months, from May to October. Two months (April and November) are transitional, sometimes there are temperature above {{convert|20|?C|0|abbr=on}}. December, January, February and March are the coldest months, with average temperatures (of these four months) over {{convert|13.1|?C|?F|abbr=on}} near the city centre ({{convert|13.9|?C|?F|abbr=on}} near sea) during the day and {{convert|3.7|?C|?F|abbr=on}} near the city centre ({{convert|4.7|?C|?F|abbr=on}} near sea) at night. The average [[relative humidity]] is 74.8%, varying from 72% in July to 77% in November and December.

At the time of the Emperor [[Augustus]], Rome was the largest city in the world: with a population of about one million people (about the size of London in the early 19th century, when London was the largest city in the world).&lt;ref&gt;N.Morley, ''Metropolis and Hinterland'' (Cambridge, 1996) 33?9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duiker, 2001. page 149.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-20586744.html ''Abstrat of'' The population of ancient Rome.] by Glenn R. Storey. HighBeam Research. Written 1997-12-1. Retrieved 2007-4-22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/journals/CP/29/2/Population_of_Rome*.html#note6 The Population of Rome] by Whitney J. Oates. Originally published in ''Classical Philology''.
Vol. 29, No. 2 (April 1934), pp101-116. Retrieved 2007-4-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|fall of the Western Roman Empire]], the city's population fell dramatically to less than 50,000 people, and continued to either stagnate or shrink until the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Llewellyn, ''Rome in the Dark Ages'' (London 1993), p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861?1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] annexed Rome in 1870, the city had a population of about 200,000, which rapidly increased to 600,000 by the eve of World War I. The [[Fascism|Fascist]] regime of Mussolini tried to block an excessive demographic rise of the city, but failed to prevent it from reaching one million people by early 1930s. After the Second World War, growth continued, helped by a post-war economic boom. A construction boom also created a large number of suburbs during the 1950s and 1960s.

In mid-2010, there were 2,754,440 residents in the city proper, while some 4.2&amp;nbsp;million people lived in the greater Rome area (which can be approximately identified with its administrative [[Province of Rome|province]], with a population density of about 800inhab./km2 stretching over more than 5,000 km2). Minors (children ages 18 and younger) totalled 17.00 percent of the population compared to pensioners who number 20.76 percent. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06 percent (minors) and 19.94 percent (pensioners). The average age of a Roman resident is 43 compared to the Italian average of 42. In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Rome grew by 6.54 percent, while Italy as a whole grew by 3.56 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demo.istat.it/bil2007/index.html |title=Statistiche demografiche ISTAT |publisher=Demo.istat.it |accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current birth rate of Rome is 9.10 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births.

===Ethnic groups===
According to the latest statistics conducted by ISTAT,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demo.istat.it/str2009/index.html |title=Statistiche demografiche ISTAT |publisher=Demo.istat.it |accessdate=30 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; approximately 9.5% of the population consists of non-Italians. About half of the immigrant population consists of those of various other European origins (chiefly Romanian, Polish, Ukrainian, and Albanian) numbering a combined total of 131,118 or 4.7 percent of the population. The remaining 4.8 percent are those with non-European origins, chiefly Filipinos (26,933), Bangladeshis (12,154), Peruvians (10,530), and Chinese (10,283).

The Esquilino district, off [[Termini Station (Rome)|Termini Railway Station]], has evolved into a largely immigrant neighbourhood, it is now seen as Rome's Chinatown, but in fact immigrants from more than a hundred different countries crowd its busy streets and piazzas. A thriving commercial district, Esquilino boasts dozens of restaurants featuring every kind of international cuisine. There are innumerable wholesale clothes shops: of the 1,300 or so commercial premises operating in the district 800 are Chinese-owned, around 300 are run by immigrants from other countries around the world and some 200 are owned by Italians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romepost.it/Rioni_of_Rome_Esquilino.htm Rome Post ? what's happening in Rome]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to serve the growing number Muslims community, in 1995 the first [[Mosque of Rome|Mosque in Rome]] was inaugurated, the largest mosque in Europe.

Hundreds of [[Romani people|Romani gypsies]] live in illegal trailer camps on the city's outskirts. There is a growing population of homeless people in Rome, mostly not Italian and estimated at 7000.

===Religion===
{{Main|Religion in Rome}}
[[File:Vatikan Kolonaden Petersdom.jpg|thumb|center|800px|&lt;center&gt;[[Saint Peter's Square|St. Peter's Square]] in [[Vatican City]].&lt;/center&gt;]]
Much like the rest of Italy, Rome is predominantly Roman Catholic, and the city has been an important centre of religion and pilgrimage for centuries, the base of the ancient Roman Religion with the [[Pontifex Maximus|pontifex maximus]] and later the seat of the [[Vatican City]] and the pope. Before the arrival of the Christians in Rome, the [[Religion in ancient Rome|Religio Romana]] (literally, the &quot;Roman Religion&quot;) was the major religion of the city in classical antiquity. The first gods held sacred by the Romans were [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], the most high, and [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], god of war, and father of Rome's twin founders, [[Romulus and Remus]], according to tradition. Other gods and goddesses such as [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]] and [[Minerva]] were honoured. Rome was also the base of several mystery cults, such as [[Mithraic Mysteries|Mithraism]]. Later, after [[Saint Peter|St Peter]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|St Paul]] were martyred in the city, and the first Christians began to arrive, Rome became Christian, and the St. Peter's Basilica was first constructed in 313 AD. Despite some interruptions (such as the [[Avignon Papacy|Avignon papacy]]), Rome has for centuries been the home of the Roman Catholic Church and the [[Pope|bishop of Rome]], otherwise known as the pope.

Despite the fact that Rome is home to the Vatican City and [[St. Peter's Basilica]], Rome's cathedral is the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran]], located to the south-east of the city-centre. There are around 900 churches in Rome in total, aside from the cathedral itself, some others of note include: the [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]], the [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls]], the [[Basilica di San Clemente]], [[San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane]] and the [[Church of the Gesu]]. There are also the ancient [[Catacombs of Rome]] underneath the city. Numerous highly important religious educational institutions are also in Rome, such as the [[Pontifical Lateran University]], [[Pontifical Biblical Institute]], [[Pontifical Gregorian University]], and [[Pontifical Oriental Institute]].

The territory of Vatican City is part of the ''Mons Vaticanus'', and of the adjacent former Vatican Fields, where [[St. Peter's Basilica]], the [[Apostolic Palace]], the [[Sistine Chapel]], and museums were built, along with various other buildings. The area was part of the Roman [[rione]] of [[borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]] until 1929. Being separated from the city on the west bank of the [[Tiber River|Tiber]] river, the area was an outcrop of the city that was protected by being included within the walls of [[Pope Leo IV|Leo IV]], later expanded by the current fortification walls of [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]]/[[Pope Pius IV|Pius IV]]/[[Pope Urban VIII|Urban VIII]]. [[File:Piazza Esquilino, Santa Maria Maggiore.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]] is one of the largest churches in the city.]]

When the [[Lateran Treaty]] of 1929 that gave the state its present form was being prepared, the boundaries of the proposed territory was influenced by the fact that much of it was all but enclosed by this loop. For some tracts of the frontier, there was no wall, but the line of certain buildings supplied part of the boundary, and for a small part of the frontier a modern wall was constructed.

The territory includes [[Saint Peter's Square]], separated from the territory of Italy only by a white line along the limit of the square, where it touches Piazza Pio XII. St. Peter's Square is reached through the [[Via della Conciliazione]], which runs from the Tiber River to St. Peter's. This grand approach was constructed by [[Benito Mussolini]] after the conclusion of the Lateran Treaty. According to the Lateran Treaty, certain [[properties of the Holy See]] that are located in Italian territory, most notably [[Castel Gandolfo]] and the [[major basilica]]s, enjoy extraterritorial status similar to that of foreign [[Diplomatic mission|embassies]].

In recent years, there has been a significant growth in Rome's Muslim community, mainly due to immigration from North African and Middle Eastern countries into the city. As a consequence of this increase of the local practitioners of the Islamic faith, the ''comune'' promoted the building of the largest mosque in Europe, which was designed by architect [[Paolo Portoghesi]] and inaugurated on 21 June 1995. Since the end of the Roman Republic Rome is also the center of an important Jewish community,&lt;ref&gt;Coarelli, p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; which was once based in [[Trastevere]], and later in the [[Roman Ghetto]]. There lies also the major synagogue in Rome, the ''[[Great Synagogue of Rome|Tempio Maggiore]]''.

===Architecture===
{{Main|Architecture of Rome}}

[[File:Pantheon Front.jpg|thumb|The [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]].]]

Rome's architecture over the centuries has greatly developed, especially from the Classical and Imperial Roman styles to modern [[Fascist architecture]]. Rome was for a period one of the world's main epicentres of classical architecture, developing new forms such as the [[arch]], the [[dome]] and the [[vault (architecture)|vault]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Eyewitness&quot;&gt;Eyewitness Travel (2006), pg.36?37.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries was also widely used in Roman architecture, and later the city became one of the main centres of [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] architecture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eyewitness&quot;/&gt;

====Ancient Rome====

[[File:Roma San Paolo fuori le mura BW 1.JPG|thumb|The [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls|Basilica of San Paolo fuori le Mura]].]]
{{Main|List of ancient monuments in Rome|Ancient Roman architecture}}
One of the symbols of Rome is the [[Colosseum]] (70?80 AD), the largest [[amphitheatre]] ever built in the [[Roman Empire]]. Originally capable of seating 60,000 spectators, it was used for [[gladiator]]ial combat. A list of important monuments and sites of ancient Rome includes the [[Roman Forum]], the [[Domus Aurea]], the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], [[Trajan's Column]], [[Trajan's Market]], the [[Catacombs of Rome|Catacombs]], the [[Circus Maximus]], the [[Baths of Caracalla]], [[Castel Sant'Angelo]], the [[Mausoleum of Augustus]], the [[Ara Pacis]], the [[Arch of Constantine]], the [[Pyramid of Cestius]], and the [[Bocca della Verit?]].

====Medieval====
Often overlooked, Rome's medieval heritage is one of the largest in Italian cities. Basilicas dating from the [[Early Christianity|Paleochristian]] age include [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore|Santa Maria Maggiore]] and [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls|San Paolo Fuori le Mura]] (the latter largely rebuilt in the 19th century), both housing precious 4th century AD mosaics. Later notable medieval mosaic and fresco art can be also found in the churches of [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]], [[Santi Quattro Coronati]], and [[Santa Prassede]]. Lay buildings include a number of towers, the largest being the [[Torre delle Milizie]] and the [[Torre dei Conti]], both next the Roman Forum, and the huge staircase leading to the basilica of [[Santa Maria in Aracoeli|Santa Maria in Ara Coeli]].

====Renaissance and Baroque====
Rome was a major world centre of the [[Renaissance]], second only to [[Florence]], and was profoundly affected by the movement. Among others, a masterpiece of [[Renaissance architecture]] in Rome is the [[Capitoline Hill|Piazza del Campidoglio]] by [[Michelangelo]]. During this period, the great aristocratic families of Rome used to build opulent dwellings as the [[Quirinal Palace|Palazzo del Quirinale]] (now seat of the [[President of Italy|President of the Italian Republic]]), the [[Palazzo Venezia]], the [[Palazzo Farnese]], the [[Palazzo Barberini]], the [[Palazzo Chigi]] (now seat of the [[Prime Minister of Italy|Italian Prime Minister]]), the [[Palazzo Spada]], the [[Palazzo della Cancelleria]], and the [[Villa Farnesina]].

{{wide image|Piazza del Campidoglio panoramic view 39948px.jpg|800px|&lt;center&gt;Panoramic view of [[Piazza del Campidoglio]], with the [[Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius]].&lt;/center&gt;}}

Many of the famous city's squares ? some huge, majestic and often adorned with [[List of obelisks in Rome|obelisks]], some small and pictoresque ? got their present shape during the Renaissance and Baroque. The principal ones are [[Piazza Navona]], [[Spanish Steps|Piazza di Spagna]], [[Campo de' Fiori]], [[Piazza Venezia]], [[Palazzo Farnese, Rome|Piazza Farnese]], [[Pantheon, Rome|Piazza della Rotonda]] and [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva|Piazza della Minerva]]. One of the most emblematic examples of [[Baroque|Baroque art]] is the [[Trevi Fountain|Fontana di Trevi]] by [[Nicola Salvi]]. Other notable 17th-century [[baroque architecture|baroque palaces]] are the [[Palazzo Madama]], now the seat of the [[Italian Senate]] and the [[Palazzo Montecitorio]], now the seat of the [[Italian Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies of Italy]].

====Neoclassicism====

[[File:RomaAltarePatriaTramonto.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Monument to Vittorio Emanuele II]].]]
[[File:Roma Piazza del Popolo BW 1.JPG|thumb|left|[[Piazza del Popolo]].]]
[[File:Palazzo della Farnesina.jpg|thumb|right|[[Palazzo della Farnesina]], seat of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.]]

In 1870, Rome became the capital city of the new [[Kingdom of Italy (1861?1946)|Kingdom of Italy]]. During this time, [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassicism]], a building style influenced by the architecture of [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], became a predominant influence in [[Architecture of ancient Rome|Roman architecture]]. During this period, many great palaces in neoclassical styles were built to host ministries, embassies, and other governing agencies. One of the best-known symbols of Roman neoclassicism is the [[Monument to Vittorio Emanuele II|Monument of Vittorio Emanuele II]] or &quot;Altar of the Fatherland&quot;, where the [[Monument to Vittorio Emanuele II#Unknown soldier|Grave of the Unknown Soldier]], that represents the 650,000 Italians that fell in World War I, is located.

====Fascist architecture====
{{See also|Fascist architecture}}

The Fascist regime that ruled in Italy between 1922 and 1943 developed an architectural style that was characterised by its links with ancient Roman architecture. The most important Fascist site in Rome is the [[EUR, Rome|E.U.R]] district, designed in 1938 by [[Marcello Piacentini]]. It was originally conceived for the [[Esposizione universale (1942)|1942 world exhibition]], and was called &quot;E.42&quot; (''&quot;Esposizione 42&quot;''). The world exhibition, however, never took place because Italy entered the Second World War in 1940. The most representative building of the Fascist style at E.U.R. is the [[Palazzo della Civilt? Italiana]] (1938?1943), the iconic design of which has been labelled the cubic of Square Colosseum. After World War II, the Roman authorities found that they already had the seed of an off-centre business district of the type that other capitals were still planning ([[London Docklands]] and [[La D?fense]] in Paris). Also the [[Palazzo della Farnesina]], the current seat of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Italy)|Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], was designed in 1935 in pure Fascist style.

===Parks and gardens===
[[File:Rome-VillaBorghese-TempleEsculape.jpg|thumb|left|The gardens of [[Villa Borghese gardens|Villa Borghese]].]]
{{Main|List of parks and gardens in Rome}}
Public parks and nature reserves cover a large area in Rome, and the city has one of the largest areas of green space amongst European capitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.romaperkyoto.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=35&amp;Itemid=52|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080204030918/http://www.romaperkyoto.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=35&amp;Itemid=52|archivedate=4 February 2008 |title=Green Areas |publisher=RomaPerKyoto.org |accessdate=9 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable part of this green space is represented by the large number of villas and landscaped gardens created by the Italian aristocracy. While many villas were destroyed during the building boom of the late 19th century, a great many remain. The most notable of these are [[Villa Borghese gardens|Villa Borghese]], [[Villa Ada]], and [[Villa Doria Pamphili]]. Villa Doria Pamphili is west of the Gianicolo hill comprising some 1.8&amp;nbsp;km2. Also on the Gianicolo hill there is Villa Sciarra, with playgrounds for children and shaded walking areas. In the nearby area of Trastevere the Orto Botanico (Botanical Garden) is a cool and shady green space. The old Roman hippodrome (Circus Maximus) is another large green space but the main attraction is the ancient site of the chariot racing and it has few trees. Nearby is the lush Villa Celimontana, close to the gardens surrounding the Baths of Caracalla and Rose Garden (?roseto comunale?). The Villa Borghese garden is the best known large green space in Rome, with famous art galleries among its shaded walks. It is close to the Spanish Steps that climb the slope to the Piazza Trinita dei Monti from the Piazza di Spagna,and [[Piazza del Popolo]] with its Augustinian Church built in the 13th century. Rome also has a number of regional parks of much more recent origin including the [[Pineto Regional Park]] and the Appian Way Regional Park. There are also nature reserves at Marcigliana and at Tenuta di Castelporziano.

===Fountains and aqueducts===
{{Main|List of fountains in Rome|List of aqueducts in the city of Rome}}
{{Wide image|Trevi Pano.jpg|800px|&lt;center&gt;The [[Trevi Fountain]], one of the most famous in the world.&lt;/center&gt;}}

[[File:Rom Spanish Steps BW 1.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Fontana della Barcaccia]] in [[Piazza di Spagna]].]]

Rome is a city famous for its numerous fountains, built in all different styles, from Classical and Medieval, to Baroque and Neoclassical. The city has had [[fountain]]s for more than two thousand years, and they have provided drinking water and decorated the [[piazza]]s of Rome. During the [[Roman Empire]], in 98 AD, according to [[Sextus Julius Frontinus]], the Roman consul who was named ''curator aquarum'' or guardian of the water of the city, Rome had nine [[aqueduct]]s which fed 39 monumental fountains and 591 public basins, not counting the water supplied to the Imperial household, baths and owners of private villas. Each of the major fountains was connected to two different aqueducts, in case one was shut down for service.&lt;ref&gt;Frontin, Les Aqueducs de la ville de Rome, translation and commentary by Pierre Grimal, Soci?t? d'?dition Les Belles Lettres, Paris, 1944.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 17th and 18th century the Roman popes reconstructed other ruined Roman acqueducts and built new display fountains to mark their termini, launching the golden age of the Roman fountain. The fountains of Rome, like the paintings of [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], were expressions of the new style of [[Baroque]] art. They were crowded with allegorical figures, and filled with emotion and movement. In these fountains, sculpture became the principal element, and the water was used simply to animate and decorate the sculptures. They, like baroque gardens, were &quot;a visual representation of confidence and power.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Italian Gardens, a Cultural History'', Helen Attlee. Francis Lincoln Limited, London 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statues===
{{main|Talking statues of Rome}}
[[File:Kolumna Aureliusza.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The 39.7 m tall&lt;ref&gt;Height of shaft, base and above ground: {{harnvb|Jones|2000|p=220}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Column of Marcus Aurelius]].]]
Rome is well known for its statues but, in particular, the [[talking statues of Rome]]. These are usually ancient statues which have become popular soapboxes for political and social discussion, and places for people to (often satirically) voice their opinions. There are two main talking statues: the [[Pasquino]] and the [[Marforio]], yet there are four other noted ones: [[il Babuino]], [[Madama Lucrezia]], [[il Facchino]] and [[Abbot Luigi]]. Most of these statues are ancient Roman or classical, and most of them also depict mythical gods, ancient people or legendary figures; il Pasquino represents [[Menelaus]], Abbot Luigi is an unknown Roman magistrate, il Babuino is supposed to be [[Silenus]], [[Marforio]] represents [[Oceanus]], Madama Lucrezia is a bust of [[Isis]], and [[il Facchino]] is the only non-Roman statue, created in 1580, and not representing anyone in particular. They are often, due to their status, covered with placards or [[graffiti]] expressing political ideas and points of view. Other statues in the city, which are not related to the talking statues, include those of the Ponte Sant'Angelo, or several monuments scattered across the city, such as that to [[Giordano Bruno]] in the Campo de'Fiori.

===Obelisks and columns===
{{Main|List of obelisks in Rome}}
The city contains eight [[ancient Egypt]]ian and five [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] [[obelisk]]s, together with a number of more modern obelisks; there was also formerly (until 2005) an [[Aksumite Empire|ancient Ethiopian]] obelisk in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.initaly.com/regions/classic/obelisks.htm |title=Chasing Obelisks in Rome |publisher=Initaly.com |accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city contains some of obelisks in [[piazza]]s, such as in [[Piazza Navona]], [[Saint Peter's Square|St Peter's Square]], [[Piazza di Monte Citorio|Piazza Montecitorio]], and [[Piazza del Popolo]], and others in [[villa]]s, [[thermae]] parks and gardens, such as in [[Villa Mattei|Villa Celimontana]], the [[Baths of Diocletian]], and the [[Pincian Hill]]. Moreover, the centre of Rome hosts also [[Trajan's column|Trajan's]] and [[Column of Marcus Aurelius|Antonine Column]], two ancient Roman columns with spiral relief.

===Bridges===
{{Main|List of bridges in Rome}}
[[File:Bridge of Angels.jpg|thumb|[[Ponte Sant'Angelo|Bridge of Angels]] which leads to [[Castel Sant'Angelo]].]]
The city of Rome contains numerous famous bridges which cross the [[Tiber River|Tiber]]. Famous ones include the [[Pons Cestius|Ponte Cestio]], the [[Ponte Milvio]], the [[Ponte Nomentano]], the [[Ponte Sant'Angelo]], the [[Ponte Vittorio Emanuele II]], the [[Ponte Sisto]] and the [[Pons Fabricius|Ponte dei Quattro Capi]]. Currently there are five [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] bridges still remaining in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citrag.it/archi/page/bridges/e_f_pn_ro.htm |title=The Bridges of Ancient Rome |publisher=Citrag.it |accessdate=3 February 2010}}{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the city's public bridges were built in Classical or Renaissance style, but also in Baroque, Neoclassical and Modern styles. According to the [[Encyclop?dia Britannica]], the finest ancient bridge remaining in Rome is the [[Ponte Sant'Angelo]], which was completed in 135AD, and was decorated with 10 statues of the angels, designed by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]] in 1688.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Encyclop?dia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/523159/SantAngelo-Bridge |title=Sant'Angelo Bridge |accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catacombs===
{{Main|Catacombs of Rome}}
Rome has extensive amount of ancient catacombs, or underground burial places under or near the city, of which there are at least forty, some discovered only in recent decades. Though most famous for Christian burials, they include [[Religion in ancient Rome|pagan]] and Jewish burials, either in separate catacombs or mixed together. The first large-scale catacombs were excavated from the 2nd century onwards. Originally they were carved through [[tuff]], a soft [[volcanic rock]], outside the boundaries of the city, because [[Roman law]] forbade burial places within city limits. Currently maintenance of the catacombs is in the hands of the [[Pope|Papacy]] which has invested in the [[Salesians of Don Bosco]] the supervision of the Catacombs of St. Callixtus on the outskirts of Rome.

==Economy==

{{Wide image|Z eur1.jpg|800px|&lt;center&gt;Panoramic view of [[EUR, Rome|EUR]] business district.&lt;/center&gt;}}

Being the capital city of Italy, Rome hosts all the principal institutions of the nation, like the Presidency of the Republic, the government (and its single Ministeri), the Parliament, the main judicial Courts, and the diplomatic representatives of all the countries for the states of Italy and the Vatican City (curiously, Rome also hosts, in the Italian part of its territory, the Embassy of Italy for the Vatican City, a unique case of an Embassy within the boundaries of its own country). Many international institutions are located in Rome, notably cultural and scientific ones ? such as the American Institute, the British School, the French Academy, the Scandinavian Institutes, the German Archaeological Institute ? for the honour of scholarship in the Eternal City, and humanitarian ones, such as the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]]. Rome, also hosts major international and worldwide political and cultural organisations, such as the [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]] (IFAD), [[World Food Programme]] (WFP), the [[NATO Defence College]] and ICCROM, the International Center for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property [http://www.iccrom.org/]. Rome is currently an beta+ [[Global city|world city]], falling down from its alpha- status in 2008, along with [[Berlin]], [[Stockholm]], [[Athens]], [[Prague]], [[Montreal]] and [[Vancouver]], to name a few.&lt;ref name=&quot;lboro.ac.uk&quot;/&gt; With a score of 2.56, Rome was also ranked in 2010 as 28th in the Global Cities Index (moving up two places from its 2008 position), being the highest-ranking city in Italy (Milan comes second at 42nd).&lt;ref name=&quot;atkearney.at&quot;/&gt; Furthermore, Rome was in 2008, also ranked 15th out of all the cities of the world for global importance, mainly for cultural experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=4509 |title=The 2008 Global Cities Index |publisher=Foreignpolicy.com |date=15 October 2008 |accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a 2005 GDP of ?94.376&amp;nbsp;billion (US$121.5&amp;nbsp;billion),&lt;ref name=&quot;rapporto2006&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.censis.it/277/372/5732/5766/5783/5784/content.asp |title=Rapporto Censis 2006 |publisher=Censis.it |accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the city produces 6.7% of the national GDP (more than any other single city in Italy), and its unemployment rate, lowered from 11.1% to 6.5% between 2001 and 2005, is now one of the lowest rates of all the European Union capital cities.&lt;ref name=&quot;rapporto2006&quot;/&gt; Rome grows +4.4% annually and continues to grow at a higher rate in comparison to any other city in the rest of the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;rapporto2006&quot;/&gt; This means that were Rome a country, it would be the world's 52nd richest country by GDP, near to the size to that of Egypt. Rome also had a 2003 GDP per capita of ?29,153 (US$ 37,412), which was second in Italy, (after [[Milan]]), and is more than 134.1% of the EU average GDP per capita.&lt;ref name=&quot;observatoribarcelona.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.observatoribarcelona.org/eng/Indicadors.php?IdentificadorTema=1&amp;Identificador=11 Observatoribarcelona.org]{{Dead link|date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rome, on the whole, has the highest total earnings in Italy, reaching ?47,076,890,463 in 2008,&lt;ref name=&quot;ilsole24ore.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilsole24ore.com/speciali/redditi_comuni_08/ |title=La classifica dei redditi nei comuni capoluogo di provincia |publisher=Il Sole 24 ORE |accessdate=14 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet, in terms of average workers' incomes, the city places itself 9th in Italy, with ?24,509&lt;ref name=&quot;ilsole24ore.com&quot;/&gt; On a global level, Rome's workers receive the 30th highest wages in 2009, coming three places higher than in 2008, in which the city ranked 33rd.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citymayors.com/economics/richest_cities.html |title=World's richest cities in 2009 |publisher=City Mayors |date=22 August 2009 |accessdate=14 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the economy of Rome is characterised by the absence of heavy industry and it is largely dominated by [[service (economics)|services]], high-technology companies (IT, aerospace, defence, telecommunications), research, construction and commercial activities (especially banking), and the huge development of tourism are very dynamic and extremely important to its economy. Rome's international airport, [[Fiumicino]], is the largest in Italy, and the city hosts the head offices of the vast majority of the major Italian companies, as well as the headquarters of three of the world's 100 largest companies: [[Enel]], [[Eni]], and [[Telecom Italia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Forbes&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/2006/03/29/06f2k_worlds-largest-public-companies_land.html|title=The World's 2000 Largest Public Companies|first=Scott|last=DeCarlo |date=30 March 2006 |work=Forbes|accessdate=16 January 2007}}{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Universities, national radio and television and the movie industry in Rome are also important parts of the economy: Rome is also the hub of the [[Cinema of Italy|Italian film industry]], thanks to the [[Cinecitt?]] studios, working since the 1930s. The city is also a centre for banking and insurance as well as electronics, energy, transport, and aerospace industries. Numerous international companies and agencies headquarters, government ministries, conference centres, sports venues, and museums are located in Rome's principal business districts: the [[Esposizione Universale Roma]] (EUR); the ''Torrino'' (further south from the EUR); the ''Magliana''; the ''Parco de' Medici-Laurentina'' and the so-called ''Tiburtina-valley'' along the ancient [[Via Tiburtina]].

==Education==
Rome is a nation-wide and major international centre for higher education, containing numerous academies, colleges and universities. According to the City Brands Index, Rome is considered the world's second most historically, educationally and culturally interesting and beautiful city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citybrandsindex.com/downloads/cbi2006-q4-free.pdf &quot;How the world views its cities&quot; ? The Anholt City Brands Index 2006]{{Dead link|date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It boasts a large variety of academies and colleges, and has always been a major worldwide intellectual and educational centre, especially during [[Ancient Rome]] and the [[Renaissance]], along with [[Florence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01083b.htm |work=Catholic Encyclopedia |title=Roman Academies |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 March 1907 |accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rome has a large number of universities and colleges. Its first university, [[Sapienza University of Rome|La Sapienza]] (founded in 1303), is the largest in Europe and the second-largest in the world, with more than 140,000 students attending; in 2005 it ranked as Europe's 33rd best university&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arwu.org/rank/2005/ARWU2005_TopEuro.htm Arwu.org]{{Dead link|date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and currently ranks amongst Europe's 50 and the world's 150 best colleges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arwu.org/rank2008/ARWU2008_TopEuro(EN).htm Arwu.org]{{Dead link|date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to decrease the overcrowding of La Sapienza, two new public universities were founded during the last decades: [[University of Rome Tor Vergata|Tor Vergata]] in 1982, and [[Roma Tre University|Roma Tre]] in 1992. Rome hosts also the [http://www.sog.luiss.it LUISS School of Government], Italy's most important graduate university in the areas of international affairs and European studies.

Rome contains also a large number of [[pontifical university|pontifical universities]] and other institutes, including the [[British School at Rome]], the [[French Academy in Rome|French School in Rome]], the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]] (The oldest [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] university in the world, founded in 1551), [[Istituto Europeo di Design]], the [[St. John's University (Italy)|St. John's University]], the [[American University of Rome]], the [[Lorenzo de' Medici School|Scuola Lorenzo de' Medici]], the Link [[Link Campus|Campus of Malta]], and the [[Universit? Campus Bio-Medico]]. Rome is also the location of the [[John Felice Rome Center]], a campus of [[Loyola University Chicago]]. The [[Roman Colleges]] are several [[seminary|seminaries]] for students from foreign countries studying for the [[Catholic priesthood|priesthood]] at the Pontifical Universities.&lt;ref name=&quot;NAC&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Rome is an important centre for music, and it has an intense musical scene, including several prestigious music conservatories and theatres. It hosts the [[Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia]] (founded in 1585), for which new concert halls have been built in the new [[Parco della Musica]], one of the largest musical venues in the world. Rome also has an opera house, the [[Teatro dell'Opera di Roma]], as well as several minor musical institutions. The city also played host to the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1991|Eurovision Song Contest]] in 1991 and the [[MTV Europe Music Awards 2004|MTV Europe Music Awards]] in 2004.

Rome has also had a major impact in music history. The [[Roman School]] was a group of composers of predominantly church music, which were active in the city during the 16th and 17th centuries, therefore spanning the late [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] and early [[Baroque music|Baroque]] eras. The term also refers to the music they produced. Many of the composers had a direct connection to the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and the [[Sistine Chapel|papal chapel]], though they worked at several churches; stylistically they are often contrasted with the [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian School]] of composers, a concurrent movement which was much more progressive. By far the most famous composer of the Roman School is [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]], whose name has been associated for four hundred years with smooth, clear, [[polyphony|polyphonic]] perfection. However, there were other composers working in Rome, and in a variety of styles and forms.

Rome today is one of the most important tourist destinations of the world, due to the incalculable immensity of its archaeological and artistic treasures, as well as for the charm of its unique traditions, the beauty of its panoramic views, and the majesty of its magnificent &quot;villas&quot; (parks). Among the most significant resources are the many museums ? (Musei Capitolini, the Vatican Museums, Galleria Borghese, including those dedicated to modern and contemporary art and great many others) ? [[aqueduct]]s, [[fountain]]s, churches, [[palace]]s, historical buildings, the [[monument]]s and ruins of the [[Roman Forum]], and the [[Catacombs]]. Rome is the 3rd most visited city in the EU, after London and Paris, and receives an average of 7?10&amp;nbsp;million tourists a year, which sometimes doubles on holy years. The [[Colosseum]] (4&amp;nbsp;million tourists) and the [[Vatican Museums]] (4.2&amp;nbsp;million tourists) are the 39th and 37th (respectively) most visited places in the world, according to a recent study.&lt;ref name=&quot;itvnews.tv&quot;&gt;[http://www.itvnews.tv/Blog/Blog/the-50-most-visited-places.html ITVnews.tv]{{Dead link|date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rome is a major archaeological hub, and one of the world's main centres of [[archaeology|archaeological research]]. There are numerous cultural and research institutes located in the city, such as the [[American Academy in Rome]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.romanculture.org/index.php?page=airc-hc-rome-program-in-archaeology-and-classical-studies |title=AIRC-HC Program in Archaeology, Classics, and Mediterranean Culture |publisher=Romanculture.org |accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and The Swedish Institute at Rome,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isvroma.it/public/EN/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=13&amp;Itemid=%20 |title=Isvroma.it |publisher=Isvroma.it |accessdate=3 February 2010 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080708234610/http://www.isvroma.it/public/EN/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=13&amp;Itemid=+ |archivedate=8 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; to name a few.

{{Main|Roman cuisine}}
Rome's cuisine has evolved through centuries and periods of social, cultural, and political changes. Rome became a major gastronomical centre during [[Ancient Rome]]. Ancient [[Roman Cuisine]] was highly influenced by Ancient Greek culture, and after, the empire's enormous expansion exposed Romans to many new, provincial culinary habits and cooking techniques. In the beginning, the differences between social classes were not very great, but disparities developed with the empire's growth. Later, during the [[Renaissance]], Rome became well known as a centre of high-cuisine, since some of the best chefs of the time, worked for the popes. An example of this could be [[Bartolomeo Scappi]], who was a chef, working for [[Pope Pius IV|Pius IV]] in the Vatican kitchen, and he acquired fame in 1570 when his cookbook ''Opera dell'arte del cucinare'' was published. In the book he lists approximately 1000 recipes of the Renaissance [[cuisine]] and describes cooking techniques and tools, giving the first known picture of a [[fork]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rolland_1&quot;&gt;{{Harv|Rolland|2006|p=273}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the city is home to numerous formidable and traditional [[List of Italian dishes|Italian dishes]]. A Jewish influence can be seen, as Jews have lived in Rome since the 1st century BCE. Vegetables, especially [[artichoke|globe artichoke]]s, are common.&lt;ref&gt;Piras, 291.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of these include &quot;''[[Saltimbocca]] alla Romana''&quot; ? a veal cutlet, Roman-style; topped with raw ham and sage and simmered with white wine and butter; &quot;''[[Carciofi alla giudia]]''&quot; ? artichokes fried in olive oil, typical of Roman Jewish cooking; &quot;''[[Carciofi alla romana]]''&quot; ? artichokes Roman-style; outer leaves removed, stuffed with mint, garlic, breadcrumbs and braised; &quot;''[[Carbonara|Spaghetti alla carbonara]]''&quot; ? spaghetti with [[bacon]], [[egg (food)|eggs]] and [[pecorino]], and &quot;''[[Gnocchi]] di semolino alla romana''&quot; ? [[semolina]] dumpling, Roman-style, to name but a few.

The {{convert|99|acre|ha|adj=on}} studio complex is {{convert|5.6|mi|km}} from the centre of Rome and is part of one of the biggest production communities in the world, second only to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]], with well over 5,000 professionals ? from period costume makers to visual effects specialists. More than 3,000 productions have been made on its lot, from recent features like [[The Passion of the Christ]], [[Gangs of New York]], [[Rome (TV series)|HBO's Rome]], [[The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou|The Life Aquatic]] and [[Dino De Laurentiis]]? [[The Decameron|Decameron]], to such cinema classics as [[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]], [[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]], and the films of [[Federico Fellini]].

Founded in 1937 by [[Benito Mussolini]], the studios were bombed by the [[Western Allies]] during the Second World War. In the 1950s, Cinecitt? was the filming location for several large American film productions, and subsequently became the studio most closely associated with [[Federico Fellini]]. Today Cinecitt? is the only studio in the world with pre-production, production, and full post-production facilities on one lot, allowing directors and producers to walk in with their script and &quot;walk out&quot; with a completed film.

===Language===
{{Main|Roman dialect|Latin}}
The original language of Rome was [[Latin]], which evolved during the [[Middle Ages]] into Italian. The latter emerged as the confluence of various regional dialects, among which the [[Tuscan Language|Tuscan dialect]] predominated, but the population of Rome also developed its own dialect, the [[Romanesco]]. The ancient ''Romanesco'', used during the [[Middle Ages]], was a southern Italian dialect, very close to the [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]]. The influence of the [[Florence|Florentine]] culture during the [[renaissance]], and, above all, the immigration to Rome of many Florentines, amongst them the two [[House of Medici|Medici]] Popes ([[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] and [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]]) and their suite, caused a major shift in the dialect, which began to resemble more the Tuscan varieties. This remained largely confined to Rome until the 19th century, but then expanded to other zones of [[Lazio]] ([[Civitavecchia]], [[Latina, Lazio|Latina]]), from the beginning of the 20th century, thanks to the rising population of Rome and to better transportation systems. As a consequence, [[Romanesco]] abandoned its traditional forms to mutate into the dialect spoken within the city, which is more like standard Italian, although it remains distinct from the other Romanesco-influenced local dialects of Lazio. Dialectal literature in the traditional form [[Romanesco]] includes the works of such authors as [[Giuseppe Gioachino Belli]], [[Trilussa]], and [[Cesare Pascarella]]. Contemporary [[Romanesco]] is mainly represented by popular actors such as [[Aldo Fabrizi]], [[Alberto Sordi]], [[Nino Manfredi]], [[Anna Magnani]], [[Gigi Proietti]], [[Enrico Montesano]], and [[Carlo Verdone]].

Rome's historic contribution to language in a worldwide sense is much more extensive however. Through the process of [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanisation]], the peoples of [[Gallia]], the [[Iberian Peninsula]], Italy and [[Dacia]] developed languages which derive directly from Latin and were adopted in large areas of the world both through colonization and cultural influence. Moreover, also modern English, because of the [[Norman Conquest]], borrowed a large percentage of its vocabulary from the Latin Language. The Roman or Latin alphabet is the most widely used writing system in the world used by the greatest number of languages.&lt;ref&gt;Ostler, N. (2007), Ad Infinitum: A Biography of Latin. London: HarperCollins&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Association football|Football (soccer)]] is the most popular sport in Rome, as in the rest of the country. The city hosted the final games of the [[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934]] and [[1990 FIFA World Cup]]. The latter took place in the [[Stadio Olimpico|Olympic Stadium]], which is also the home stadium for local [[Serie A]] clubs [[A.S. Roma]] and [[S.S. Lazio]], whose rivalry has become a staple of Roman sports culture. Footballers who play for these teams and are also born in the city tend to become especially popular, as has been the case with players such as [[Francesco Totti]] and [[Daniele De Rossi]] (both for A.S. Roma). [[Atletico Roma]] is a minor team that plays in [[Lega Pro Prima Divisione|First Division]]; its home stadium is [[Stadio Flaminio]].

Rome hosted the [[1960 Summer Olympics]], with great success, using many ancient sites such as the [[Villa Borghese]] and the [[Baths of Caracalla|Thermae of Caracalla]] as venues. For the Olympic Games many new structures were created, notably the new large Olympic Stadium (which was also enlarged and renewed to host qualification and the final match of the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]]), the Villaggio Olimpico (Olympic Village, created to host the athletes and redeveloped after the games as a residential district), etc. Rome made a [[Rome bid for the 2020 Summer Olympics|bid]] to host the [[2020 Summer Olympics]] but it was withdrawn before the deadline for applicant files.&lt;ref name=&quot;olympic.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/media?articleid=138217 |title=Media |publisher=Olympic.org |date=|accessdate=2011-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bladesplace.id.au&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bladesplace.id.au/olympic-games-candidates.html |title=Candidate Cities for Future Olympic Games |publisher=Bladesplace.id.au |accessdate=17 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rugby union]] is gaining wider acceptance. The [[Stadio Flaminio]] is the home stadium for the [[Italy national rugby union team]], which has been playing in the [[Six Nations Championship]] since 2000, albeit with less than satisfactory performances, as they have never won the championship. Rome is home to local rugby teams, such as [[Unione Rugby Capitolina]], [[Rugby Roma]], and [[S.S. Lazio (rugby)|S.S. Lazio]].

Every May, Rome hosts the [[ATP World Tour Masters 1000|ATP Masters Series]] tennis tournament on the clay courts of the [[Foro Italico]]. Cycling was popular in the post-World War II period, although its popularity has faded. Rome has hosted the final portion of the [[Giro d'Italia]] twice, in 1989 and 2000. Rome is also home to other sports teams, including basketball ([[Pallacanestro Virtus Roma|Virtus Roma]]), volleyball ([[M. Roma Volley]]), [[team handball|handball]] or [[water polo|waterpolo]].

==Pilgrimage==
Rome has been a major Christian pilgrimage site since the Middle Ages. People from all over the Christian world visit Vatican City, within the city of Rome, the seat of the papacy. The Pope was the most influential figure during the Middle Ages. the city became a major pilgrimage site during the [[Middle Ages]] and the focus of struggles between the Papacy and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] starting with [[Charlemagne]], who was crowned its first emperor in Rome in 800 by [[Pope Leo III]]. Apart from brief periods as an independent city during the [[Middle Ages]], Rome kept its status as Papal capital and &quot;holy city&quot; for centuries, even when the Papacy [[Avignon papacy|briefly relocated]] to [[Avignon]] (1309?1377). {{citation needed|date=January 2012}} Catholics believe that the Vatican is the last resting place of St. Peter. to this day, thousand of believers flock to the city to Rome. One of the pilgrimage stopping point is [[scala sancta|pilate's stairs]] where, according to the Christian tradition, the steps that led up to the [[praetorium]] of [[Pontius Pilate]] in [[Jerusalem]], which [[Jesus Christ]] stood on during his [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] on his way to trial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/06/14/wsteps114.xml Steps Jesus walked to trial restored to glory], ''Daily Telegraph'', Malcolm Moore, 14/06/2007&lt;/ref&gt; The stairs were, reputedly, brought to Rome by [[Helena of Constantinople|St. Helena]] in the 4th Century. For centuries, the Scala Santa has attracted Christian pilgrims who wished to honor the Passion of Jesus.

==Transportation==
{{Main|Transport in Rome}}
[[File:Rom Fiumicino 01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport|Rome-Fiumicino Airport]] in 2008 was the [[List of the busiest airports in Europe|sixth busiest airport]] in Europe.]]

Rome is at the centre of the radial network of roads that roughly follow the lines of the ancient Roman roads that began at the [[Capitoline Hill]] and connected Rome with its empire. Today Rome is circled, at a distance of about {{convert|10|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, by the ring-road (the ''[[Grande Raccordo Anulare]]'' or ''GRA'').

Due to its location in the centre of the Italian peninsula, Rome is a principal railway node for central Italy. Rome's main train station, [[Roma Termini railway station|Termini]], is one of the biggest train stations in Europe and the most heavily used in Italy, with around 400 thousand travellers passing through every day. The second-largest station in the city, [[Roma Tiburtina railway station|Roma Tiburtina]], is currently being redeveloped as a [[High-speed rail in Italy|high-speed rail]] terminus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080523201048/http://eurostar-av.trenitalia.com/it/progetto/stazioni_rinnovate/roma_tiburtina.html ? Entry on Roma Tiburtina station on the official website of the Italian high-speed rail service] {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rome is served by three airports. The intercontinental [[Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport|Leonardo Da Vinci International Airport]] is Italy's chief airport and is commonly known as &quot;Fiumicino Airport&quot;, as it is located within the nearby [[Fiumicino|''Comune'' of Fiumicino]], south-west of Rome. The older [[Rome Ciampino Airport]] is a joint civilian and military airport. It is commonly referred to as &quot;Ciampino Airport&quot;, as it is located beside [[Ciampino]], south-east of Rome. A third airport, the [[Roma-Urbe]] Airport, is a small, low-traffic airport located about 6&amp;nbsp;km north of the city centre, which handles most helicopter and private flights.

The city suffers from traffic problems largely due to this radial street pattern, making it difficult for Romans to move easily from the vicinity of one of the radial roads to another without going into the historic centre or using the ring-road. These problems are not helped by the limited size of Rome's metro system when compared to other cities of similar size. In addition, Rome has only 21 taxis for every 10,000 inhabitants, far below other major European cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Central Rome Streets Blocked by Taxi Drivers |work=New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/30/world/europe/30rome.html?scp=93&amp;sq=Rome&amp;st=nyt |date=30 November 2007 |accessdate=10 February 2008 |first=Peter |last=Kiefer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chronic congestion caused by cars during the 1970s and 1980s led to restrictions being placed on vehicle access to the inner city-centre during the hours of daylight. Areas where these restriction apply are known as Limited Traffic Zones (''Zona a Traffico Limitato'' (ZTL) in Italian). More recently, heavy night-time traffic in [[Trastevere]] and [[Quartiere San Lorenzo|San Lorenzo]] has led to the creation of night-time ZTLs in those districts, and there are also plans to create another night-time ZTL in [[Testaccio]].

[[File:Roma MetropolitanaC e Ferrovia 2011.svg|thumb|right|Overview map of Rome's underground and rail system in 2011]]

A 2-line metro system called the ''[[Rome Metro|Metropolitana]]'' operates in Rome. Construction on the first branch started in the 1930s. The line had been planned to quickly connect the [[Roma Termini railway station|main train station]] with the newly planned E42 area in the southern suburbs, where the 1942 [[Esposizione universale (1942)|World Fair]] was supposed to be held. The event never took place because of war. The area was later partly redesigned and renamed [[Esposizione Universale Roma|EUR]] (Esposizione Universale di Roma: Rome Universal Exhibition) in the 1950s to serve as a modern business district. The line was finally opened in 1955, and it is now part of the B Line.

The A line opened in 1980 from Ottaviano to Anagnina stations, later extended in stages (1999?2000) to Battistini. In the 1990s, an extension of the B line was opened from Termini to Rebibbia. This underground network is generally reliable (although it may become very congested at peak times and during events, especially the A line) as it is relatively short. As of 2005, its total length is {{convert|38|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}.

The two existing lines, A and B, intersect at Roma Termini station. A new branch of the B line (B1) is under construction with an estimated cost of ?500&amp;nbsp;million. It is scheduled to open in 2012. B1 will connect to line B at Piazza Bologna and will have four stations over a distance of {{convert|3.9|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}. A third line, line C, is under construction with an estimated cost of ?3&amp;nbsp;billion and will have 30 stations over a distance of {{convert|25.5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}. It will partly replace the existing Rail Road line, Termini-Pantano. It will feature full automated, driverless trains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Tom |last=Kington |title=Roman remains threaten metro |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/may/14/italy.artnews |work=[[The Guardian|Guardian]] |date=14 May 2007 |accessdate=10 August 2008 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first section is due to open in 2011 and the final sections in 2015, but archaeological findings often delay underground construction work. A fourth line, D line, is also planned. It will have 22 stations over a distance of {{convert|20|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}. The first section is projected to open in 2015 and the final sections before 2035.

Above-ground public transport in Rome is made up of a bus, tram and urban train network (FR lines). The bus and tram network is run by ''Trambus S.p.A.'' under the auspices of ''Atac S.p.A.'' (which originally stood for the Municipal Bus and Tramways Company, ''Azienda Tramvie e Autobus del Comune'' in Italian). The bus network has in excess of 350 bus lines and over 8 thousand bus stops, whereas the more-limited tram system has 39&amp;nbsp;km of track and 192 stops.&lt;ref&gt;The figures are from the ATAC [http://www.atac.roma.it/index.asp?p=2&amp;i=616&amp;o=3&amp;m=1&amp;a=7&amp;ci=45&amp;tpg=2&amp;lingua=ITA website] {{it icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also one [[trolleybus]] line, opened in 2005, and additional trolleybus lines are planned.&lt;ref name=&quot;juts2009&quot;&gt;Webb, Mary (ed.)

==International entities, organisations and involvement==
[[File:FAO sede.jpg|thumb|[[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]] headquarters in Rome]]

Rome is unique in having a sovereign state located entirely within its city limits, the Vatican City. The Vatican is a enclave of Rome and a sovereign possession of the [[Holy See]], the supreme government of the Roman Catholic Church. Rome hosts foreign embassies to both Italy and the Holy See, although frequently the same ambassador is accredited to both.

Another body, the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]] (SMOM), took refuge in Rome in 1834, due to the conquest of Malta by [[Napoleon]] in 1798. It is sometimes classified as having sovereignty but does not claim any territory in Rome or anywhere else, hence leading to dispute over its actual sovereign status.

Rome is also the seat of international agencies of the [[United Nations]], such as the [[World Food Programme]] (WFP), the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), and the [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]] (IFAD).

Rome has traditionally been involved in the process of European political integration. In 1957, the city hosted the signing of the [[Treaties of Rome|Treaty of Rome]], which established the [[European Economic Community]] (predecessor to the [[European Union]]), and also played host to the official signing of the proposed [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Constitution]] in July 2004.

Rome is the seat of the [[NATO Defense College]] and is the place where the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Statute of the International Criminal Court]] was formulated.

<text>
[[File:Maison punique byrsa.jpg|thumb|right|District of Punic Byrsa]]'''Byrsa''' was the walled [[citadel]] above the harbour in ancient [[Carthage]]. It was also the name of the hill it rested on.  The name is derived from the [[Phoenician languages|Phoenician]] word for ''citadel''.
In [[Virgil]]'s account of [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido]]'s founding of [[Carthage]], when Dido and her party were encamped at Byrsa, the local Berber chieftain offered them as much land as could be covered with a single oxhide. Therefore, Dido cut an oxhide into tiny strips and set them on the ground end to end until she had completely encircled Byrsa. This story is considered apocryphal, and was most likely invented because ''Byrsa'' sounds similar to the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''?????'', meaning ''oxhide''.

The citadel dominated the city below and formed the principal military installation of Carthage. It was besieged by [[Scipio Aemilianus Africanus]] in the [[Third Punic War]] and was defeated and destroyed in [[146 BC]].

[[Image:Mozia (posizione).png|right|thumb|Position of Motya]]'''Motya''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{polytonic|?????, ?????}}; [[Italian language|Italian]]: [[Mozia]] ot Mothia; [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]]: Mozzia), was an ancient and powerful city on an island off the west coast of [[Sicily]], between Drepanum (modern [[Trapani]]) and Lilybaeum (modern [[Marsala]]). &lt;!-- (formerly San Pantaleo, now called [[Mozia]] after the ancient city)  is not correct - the original name is &quot;Motya&quot; because in times BC there was no Christian name like &quot;San Pantaleo&quot; --&gt;The eponymous (in ancient times) island renamed ''San Pantaleo'' in the 11th century by [[Basilian monk]]s is situated in a lagoon on the most western part of Sicily (nearly 850 metres long and 750 metres wide) about one km (six [[Ancient Greek units of measurement#Length|stadia]]) from the mainland of Sicily, to which it was joined by an artificial causeway (paved road), by which [[chariot]]s with large wheels could reach the town.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus]] xiv. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==
[[File:Motya from above artistic reconstruction 1 0.jpg|thumb|400 px|The city at V century b.C.]]
The foundation of the city probably dates from the [[8th century BC|8th century BCE]], about a century after the foundation of Carthage in Tunisia. It was originally a colony of the [[Phoenicians]], who were fond of choosing similar sites, and probably in the first instance merely a commercial station or emporium, but gradually rose to be a flourishing and important town. The [[ancient Greece|Greeks]], however, according to their custom, assigned it a legendary origin, and derived its name from a woman named &quot;Motya&quot;, whom they connected with the fables concerning [[Herakles]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanus of Byzantium]] ''s. v.''&lt;/ref&gt; According to coin finds the name &quot;Motya&quot; is derived from [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] &quot;Mtw&quot; and is said to mean &quot;wool-spinning center&quot;. It passed, in common with the other Phoenician settlements in Sicily, at a later period under the government or dependency of [[Carthage]], whence Diodorus calls it a Carthaginian colony; but it is probable that this is not strictly correct. &lt;ref&gt;[[Thucydides]] vi. 2 ; Diod. xiv. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; As the Greek colonies in Sicily increased in numbers and importance the Phoenicians gradually abandoned their settlements in the immediate neighbourhood of the newcomers, and concentrated themselves in the three principal colonies of [[Solus]], Panormus (modern [[Palermo]]), and Motya. &lt;ref&gt;Thuc. ''l. c.''&lt;/ref&gt; The last of these, from its proximity to Carthage and its opportune situation for communication with [[Africa]], as well as the natural strength of its position, became one of the chief strongholds of the Carthaginians, as well as one of the most important of their commercial cities in the island.&lt;ref&gt;Diod. xiv. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; It appears to have held, in both these respects, the same position which was attained at a later period by Lilybaeum.

Notwithstanding these accounts of its early importance and flourishing condition, the name of Motya is rarely mentioned in history until just before the period of its memorable siege. It is first mentioned by [[Hecataeus]], &lt;ref&gt;''ap.'' Steph. B. ''s. v.''.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Thucydides]] notices it among the chief colonies of the Phoenicians in Sicily, which still subsisted at the period of the [[Athens|Athenian]] expedition, 415 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Thuc. vi. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later (409 BCE) when the Carthaginian army under [[Hannibal Mago]] landed at the promontory of Lilybaeum, that general laid up his fleet for security in the gulf around Motya, while he advanced with his land forces along the coast to attack [[Selinus]].&lt;ref&gt; Diod. xiii. 54, 61.&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of the latter city, we are told that [[Hermocrates]], the [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracusan]] exile, who had established himself on its ruins with a numerous band of followers, laid waste the territories of Motya and Panormus;&lt;ref&gt; ''Id.'' xiii. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; and again during the second expedition of the Carthaginians under [[Hamilcar]] (407 BCE), these two cities became the permanent station of the Carthaginian fleet.&lt;ref&gt; ''Id.'' xiii. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the important position to which Motya had thus attained that led [[Dionysius I of Syracuse]] to direct his principal efforts to its reduction, when in 397 BCE he in his turn invaded the Carthaginian territory in Sicily. The citizens on the other hand, relying on succour from Carthage, made preparations for a vigorous resistance; and by cutting off the causeway which united them to the mainland, compelled Dionysius to have recourse to the tedious and laborious process of constructing a mound or mole of earth across the intervening space. Even when this was accomplished, and the military engines of Dionysius (among which the formidable [[catapult]] on this occasion made its appearance for the first time) were brought up to the walls, the Motyans continued a desperate resistance; and after the walls and towers were carried by the overwhelming forces of the enemy, still maintained the defence from street to street and from house to house. This obstinate struggle only increased the previous exasperation of the Sicilian Greeks against the Carthaginians; and when at length the troops of Dionysius made themselves masters of the city, they put the whole surviving population, men, women, and children, to the sword.&lt;ref&gt;Diod. xiv. 47-53.&lt;/ref&gt; After this the Syracusan despot placed it in charge of a garrison under an officer named [[Biton of Syracuse|Biton]]; while his brother [[Leptines of Syracuse|Leptines]] made it the station of his fleet. But the next spring (396 BCE) [[Himilcon]], the Carthaginian general, having landed at Panormus with a very large force, recovered possession of Motya with comparatively little difficulty.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'' 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Motya, however, was not destined to recover its former importance; for Himilcon, being apparently struck with the superior advantages of Lilybaeum, founded a new city on the promontory of that name, to which he transferred the few remaining inhabitants of Motya.&lt;ref&gt;Diod. xxii. 10. p. 498.&lt;/ref&gt; From this period the latter altogether disappears from history; and the little islet on which it was built, has probably ever since, as now, been inhabited only by a few fishermen. By the time the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] conquered Sicily, during the [[First Punic War]] (264&amp;ndash;241 BCE), Motya had been eclipsed by Lilybaeum.
Image:Mozia,_cothon.jpg|

It is a singular fact that, though we have no account of Motya having received any Greek population, or fallen into the hands of the Greeks before its conquest by Dionysius, there exist coins of the city with the Greek legend &quot;????????&quot;. They are, however, of great rarity, and are apparently imitated from those of the neighboring city of [[Segesta]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Eckhel]], vol. i. p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current situation==
The site of Motya, on which earlier geographers were in much doubt, has been clearly identified and described by [[William Henry Smyth]]. Between the promontory of Lilybaeum (Capo Bo?o) and that of [[Aegithallus]] (San Teodoro), the coast forms a deep bight, in front of which lies a long group of low rocky islets, called the [[Stagnone]]. Within these, and considerably nearer to the mainland, lies the small island formerly called San Pantaleo, on which the remains of an ancient city may still be distinctly traced. Fragments of the walls,, with those of two gateways, still exist, and coins as well as pieces of ancient brick and pottery &amp;ndash; the never failing indications of an ancient site &amp;ndash; were found scattered throughout the island. The circuit of the latter does not exceed 2.5 km, and it is inhabited only by a few fishermen; but is not devoid of fertility.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Henry Smyth]], ''Sicily'', pp. 235, 236.&lt;/ref&gt; The confined space on which the city was built agrees with the description of Diodorus that the houses were lofty and of solid construction, with narrow streets ({{polytonic|????????}}) between them, which facilitated the desperate defence of the inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;Diod. xiv. 48, 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeology==
In March 2006, archaeological digs uncovered rooms of a previously undiscovered house at one of the town's siege walls. The finds have shown that the town had a &quot;thriving population long after it is commonly believed to have been destroyed by the Ancient Greeks.&quot; Discovered items include cooking pans, Phoenician-style vases, altars, and looms. &lt;ref&gt;[http://ansa.it/main/notizie/awnplus/english/news/2006-03-14_1147482.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Modern Fiction==

The 399 BC Battle of Motya, part of the war of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]]'s [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]]'s tyrant [[Dionysius I of Syracuse|Dionysios I]] against [[Carthage]] is a major event in the 1965 [[historical novel]] &quot;[[The Arrows of Hercules]]&quot; by [[L. Sprague de Camp]].

Shofet

</id>
<text>
In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and several other [[Semitic languages]], '''shofet''' (plural '''shoftim''') literally means &quot;Judge&quot;, from the verb &quot;?-P-T&quot;, &quot;to pass judgment&quot;. Cognate titles exist in other Semitic cultures, notably Phoenicia.==Hebrew==
{{main|Biblical judges}}
In the Bible, the shoftim were [[tribal chief|chieftain]]s who united various [[Israelite]] tribes in time of mutual danger to defeat foreign enemies. See [[Book of Judges]] for more details.

==Punic==
In the various independent city states constituting [[Phoenicia]] proper (coasts of present Lebanon and Syria) and its &quot;Punic&quot; Mediterranean colonies a shofet (in [[Punic language|Punic]], '''''suffet''''' or '''''suffete''''') was a non-royal magistrate granted control over a city-state, sometimes functioning much in the same way as a [[Roman republic|Roman]] [[consul]].

The term is mostly widely known from the suffetes of [[Carthage]], a former Phoenician colony.  Following the overthrow of its monarchy in the [[400s&amp;nbsp;BC]], Carthage was ruled by a number of aristocratic councils presided over by two suffetes, who served in similar capacity to Roman consuls.

'''Kerkouane''' ({{lang-ar|&lt;big&gt;??????&lt;/big&gt;}}; occasionally '''Kerkuane''') is a [[Punic]] city in northeastern [[Tunisia]], near [[Cape Bon]]. This [[Phoenicia]]n city was probably abandoned during the [[First Punic War]] (c. 250 B.C.), and as a result was not rebuilt by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. It had existed for almost 400 years.

Excavations of the town have revealed ruins from the 4th and 3rd Centuries [[Anno Domini|BC]]. Around the site where the layout is clearly visible, many houses still show their walls, and the coloured clay on the facades is often still visible. The houses were built to a standard plan, in accordance with a sophisticated notion of town planning.

A sanctuary has some columns preserved, and in a small atrium parts of mosaics are found. Curbstones, doorsteps, thresholds, and floors of simple mosaic layers are found all over the ruins. Still archaeologists work on the Kerkouane site, but it is believed that the best parts have already been discovered.

Kerkouane was one of the most important Punic cities, with [[Carthage]], [[Hadrumetum]] (modern [[Sousse]]) and [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]].

==Sights==

[[UNESCO]] declared the [[Carthage|Punic]] Town of Kerkouane and its [[Necropolis of Kerkouane|Necropolis]] a [[World Heritage Site]] in 1985, citing among other things that the remains constitute the only example of a Phoenicio-Punic city to have survived.

'''Saint Louis Cathedral''' ({{lang-fr|La cath?drale Saint-Louis de Carthage}}) is an old [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[cathedral]] located in [[Carthage]], [[Tunisia]].

Situated on the peak of Byrsa Hill and near the ruins of the ancient [[Punic]] and then [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] city, the cathedral is no longer used for worship but hosts concerts of [[Music of Tunisia|Tunisian music]] and [[classical music]]. The only Roman Catholic cathedral operating in Tunisia is now the [[Cathedral of St. Vincent de Paul]] in Tunis.

== History ==
[[Al-Husayn II ibn Mahmud|Hussein II Bey]] authorised the French consul-general to build a cathedral on the site of ancient Carthage, to determine where it would be situated and to take all the land necessary for the project. His words were:

{{quotation|Praise to the one God, to whom all things return!&lt;br&gt;
We cede in perpetuity to His Majesty the [[List of French monarchs|King of France]] a location in the Malka, sufficient to raise a religious monument in honour of King [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] at the place where this prince died.&lt;ref&gt;In 1270, the [[Eighth Crusade]] arrived before [[Tunis]]. Hoping to convert the Sultan of Tunis to [[Christianity]] and use him to fight against the Sultan of [[Egypt]], the crusaders easily took Carthage but the army was struck by an epidemic of [[dysentery]]. Louis IX (Saint Louis) died on 25 August. Part of his remains were buried in Tunisia; the tomb containing them can be visited today.&lt;/ref&gt; We commit ourselves to respect and to make respected this monument consecrated by the King of France to the memory of one of his most illustrious ancestors. Greetings from the servant of God, Hussein Pasha Bey. May the Most High be propitious! Amen.&lt;br&gt;
The 17th of [[Safar]] of the year 1246. Done at [[Le Bardo|Bardo]] the 8th of August 1830. For the consul-general Mathieu de Lesseps.}}

The consul charged his son Jules with this duty. The latter, having closely examined possible sites, concluded that the chapel ought to be built on Byrsa Hill, in the centre of the Punic acropolis, where the temple of [[Asclepius|Aesculapius]] was once located. [[Louis-Philippe of France|King Louis-Philippe]] approved the project. The architect chosen conceived a building of modest proportions that contained a mix of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] styles. In any case, he succeeded in giving it the look of a rich [[marabout]] while recalling the royal chapel at [[Dreux]]. A cross, the only one standing at that time in Tunisia, topped the building.&lt;ref&gt;Mgr Alexandre Pons, ''La nouvelle ?glise d'Afrique ou le catholicisme en Alg?rie, en Tunisie et au Maroc depuis 1830''. ed. Librairie Louis Namura, [[Tunis]], 1930&lt;/ref&gt; Descendants of crusaders' families, companions of the sovereign, helped finance the construction.

[[File:St Louis Cathedral - Carthage - Tunisia - 1899.jpg|thumb|left|St. Louis Cathedral in 1899]]
Built between 1884 and 1890, under the [[French protectorate in Tunisia|French protectorate]], the cathedral acquired [[Primate (religion)|primacy]] for all of [[Africa]] when the title of primate of Africa was restored for the benefit of [[Charles Lavigerie|Cardinal Lavigerie]], titular of the Archdioceses of [[Algiers]] and of [[Patriarchate of Carthage|Carthage]], united in his person. The building was consecrated with great pomp in the presence of numerous ecclesiastical dignitaries.&lt;ref&gt;For this occasion, some relics of Saint Louis kept in [[Sicily]] were brought by the Archbishop of [[Palermo]] for, before Saint Louis' body could be brought back to France, problems conserving it made it necessary for his innards to be left in Sicily. When Tunisia became independent, these relics were taken to France and deposited in [[Sainte-Chapelle]].&lt;/ref&gt;

After his death, Cardinal Lavigerie was buried there and a funerary monument was erected in his memory. However, his body now lies in the Catholic cemetery of [[Bayonne]], on the right bank of the [[Adour]], near the Jewish cemetery.

== Architecture ==
Late 19th century French architecture tended to feature composite styles (as in the case of the [[Basilica of the Sacr? C?ur]] in [[Paris]], built in a Roman-Byzantine style in the same era). The building, constructed according to the plans of the abbot Pougnet, has a Byzantine-Moorish style, and is in the shape of a Latin cross of 65 meters by 30. The fa?ade is framed by two square towers, the [[Crossing (architecture)|crossing]] lies beneath a large [[cupola]] surrounded by eight little steeples, and there is a smaller cupola above the [[apse]]. The church contains a [[nave]] and two [[aisle]]s separated by [[arch]]es passing above and the ceiling is adorned with beams that have sculpted, painted and gilt [[Arabesque (European art)|arabesque]]s on them. The [[stained glass]] also features arabesques. The great bell weighs six tons and there is a four-bell [[carillon]] as well.

Carthago delenda est

[[Image:Marco_Porcio_Caton_Major.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cato the Elder]].]][[File:Carthage location 2.png|thumb|The location of Carthage in North Africa.]][[File:Carthage villas-romaines 1950.jpg|thumb|right|The ruins of Roman Carthage]]
'''&quot;Carthago delenda est&quot;''' ([[English language|English]]: &quot;[[Carthage]] must be destroyed&quot;) or the fuller '''&quot;Ceterum censeo Carthaginem esse delendam&quot;''' or '''&quot;Ceterum autem censeo Carthaginem esse delendam&quot;''' (English: &quot;Furthermore, I think Carthage must be destroyed&quot;) are [[List of Latin phrases|Latin political phrases]] which were popular in the [[Roman Republic]] during the latter years of the [[Punic Wars]] against [[Carthage]]. The city was indeed finally razed by the Romans after the [[Battle of Carthage (c. 149 BC)|Battle of Carthage]] in 146 BC, and its entire remaining population sold into [[slavery]].

Although no ancient source gives the phrase exactly as it is usually quoted in modern times (either ''Carthago delenda est'' or the fuller ''Ceterum censeo Carthaginem esse delendam''),  according to several ancient sources   the Roman statesman [[Cato the Elder]] would always end his speeches with some variation of this expression even if he had not been discussing Carthage in the speech.&lt;ref&gt;Charles E. Little, &quot;[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0009-8353%28193403%2929%3A6%3C429%3ATAAFOC%3E2.0.CO%3B2-O The Authenticity and Form of Cato's Saying 'Carthago Delenda Est,']&quot; ''Classical Journal'' 29 (1934), pp. 429-435.  The main ancient sources are [[Plutarch]], ''[[Parallel Lives|Cato]]'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cato_Major*.html#27 27] ({{polytonic|????? ?? ??? ??? ????????? ?? ?????}}); [[Pliny the Elder]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|NH]]'' 15.74; [[Florus]] [http://thelatinlibrary.com/florus1.html#31 1.31]; [[Aurelius Victor]] ''De viris illustribus'' 47.8.  (The evolution of the phrasing towards its modern form has been further considered in Silvia Th?rlemann-Rapperswil, &quot;'Ceterum censeo Carthaginem esse delendam,'&quot; ''Gymnasium'' 81 (1974).)&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Romans were successful in the first two Punic Wars, as they vied for dominance with the seafaring [[Phoenicia]]n city-state of Carthage in [[North Africa]] (modern day [[Tunisia]]), they suffered a number of humiliations and damaging reverses, especially at the [[Battle of Cannae]] (216 BC). This grew into an attitude of seeking vengeance and total victory, which was expressed with these phrases.
The attitude of total warfare toward Carthage resulted in the utter destruction of the city at the end of the [[Third Punic War]] and the surviving inhabitants were sold into slavery. The modern legend that the city was [[salting the earth|sown with salt]] reflects the perceived savagery of destruction.

==Modern use==
The phrase is sometimes adapted in modern usage, in a learned reference to total warfare.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ancienthistory.about.com/b/a/129595.htm &quot;Delenda est&quot; shouldn't be destroyed&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The English minister [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury|Anthony Ashley Cooper (Earl of Shaftesbury)]] revived the phrase (rendered as &quot;Delenda est Carthago&quot;) in a famous 1673 speech before Parliament during the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]], comparing England to Rome and the Dutch Republic to Carthage. [[Ben Klassen]], the founder of the anti-Semitic [[Creativity (religion)|Church of the Creator]], adopted the phrase for his movement, modifying it to &quot;Delenda est Judaica&quot;, &quot;Death to Judaism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;G. Michael,= (2009) ''Theology of Hate: A History of the World Church of Creation'' (University of Florida Press) p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;  The original phrase was again used as the title for [[Alan Wilkins (playwright)|Alan Wilkins]]' 2007 play on the Third Punic War.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.traverse.co.uk/show_detail.php?id=432 Traverse Theatre website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another, less martial, use is to affirm the correctness of one's opinion about a necessary course of action by adding either at the beginning or the end of a statement the two words &quot;Ceterum censeo&quot;. It bears some (self)irony indicating that the action has been proposed since ancient time, is still valid and has not yet been acted upon.

==Grammar==
Grammatically it expresses necessity by using a [[Gerundive#In Latin|gerundive]] with a form of the verb ''[[wikt:sum#Latin|esse]]'' &quot;to be&quot;. The fuller form ''Ceterum censeo ?'' uses the so-called [[accusative and infinitive]] for the indirect statement. This construction in Latin is known as the [[passive periphrastic]].

'''Termini Imerese'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Sicilian language|Sicilian]]: '''''T?rmini'''''; [[Greek language|Greek]]: '''Thermae Himeraeae''' - {{lang|grc|??????}}; {{lang|grc|?????? ?? ???????}}, [[Polybius|Pol.]]; {{lang|grc|?????? ??????}}, [[Ptolemy|Ptol.]]; {{lang|grc|?????}}, {{lang|grc|????? ???????}}, [[Diodorus|Diod.]], [[Latin]]: '''Thermae Himerenses''', literally [[Himera]]'s hot springs&lt;/ref&gt; is a town and ''[[comune]]'' in the province of [[Palermo]] on the northern coast of [[Sicily]], southern [[Italy]].

==History==
===Ancient===
The site where the town now sits has been populated since prehistoric times, as many archeologial excavations have shown through the years. Nevertheless, it might be stated that its recorded history started in [[409 BC]] when its more ancient neighbor, [[Himera]] (now completely within the comune's borders), was completely destroyed by the [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] army under [[Hannibal Mago]]. Those who survived the devastation promptly repaired to a site then called &quot;Thermae&quot; - the name deriving from the hot springs - which is today known as Termini; and the ancients considered Thermae as a successor to Himera.  The new town of Thermae or Therma, called for the sake of distinction Thermae Himerenses, which thus took the place of Himera, obviously derived its name from the hot springs for which it was celebrated, and the first discovery of which was connected by legends with the wanderings of [[Hercules]].&lt;ref&gt;Diod. iv. 23, v. 3; [[Pindar|Pind.]] ''Ol.'' xii. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; It appears to have early become a considerable town, though it continued, with few and brief exceptions, to be subject to the Carthaginian rule. In the [[First Punic War]] its name is repeatedly mentioned. Thus, in [[260 BC]], a body of [[ancient Rome|Roman]] troops were encamped in the neighborhood, when they were attacked by [[Hamilcar]], and defeated with heavy loss.&lt;ref&gt;Pol. i. 24; Diod. xxiii. 9. Exc. H. p.&amp;nbsp;503.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the close of the war, Thermae itself was besieged and taken by the Romans.&lt;ref&gt;Pol. i. 39; Diod. xxiii. 20. Exc. H. p.&amp;nbsp;506.&lt;/ref&gt; We have, however, no clue to the circumstances which led to the peculiar favor which this city seems to have received at the hands of its Roman conquerors. [[Cicero]] tells us that the Roman government restored to the Thermitani their city and territory, with the free use of their own laws, as a reward for their steady fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;Cic. ''Verr.'' ii: 37&lt;/ref&gt; As we see that they were on hostile terms with Rome during the First Punic War, it can only be to the subsequent period that these expressions apply; but the occasion to which they refer is unknown. In the time of Cicero, Thermae appears to have been a flourishing place, carrying on a considerable amount of trade, though the orator speaks, of it as ''oppidum non maximum''.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' ii. 46, 75, iii. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; It seems to have received a [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]] in the time of [[Augustus]], whence we find mention in inscriptions of the ''Ordo et Populus splendidissimae Coloniae Augustae Himeraeorum Thermitanorum''&lt;ref&gt;Castell. ''Inscr. Sicil.'' p.&amp;nbsp;47; Gruter. ''Inscr.'' p.&amp;nbsp;433, no. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;: and there can be very little doubt that the Thermae ''colonia'' of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] in reality refers to this town, though he evidently understood it to be Thermae Selinuntiae (modern [[Sciacca]]), as he places it on the south coast between Agrigentum (modern [[Agrigento]]) and [[Selinus]]&lt;ref&gt;Plin. iii. 8. s. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; There are little subsequent account of Thermae; but, as its name is found in [[Ptolemy]] and the Itineraries, it appears to have continued in existence throughout the period of the [[Roman Empire]], and probably never ceased to be inhabited, as the modern town of Termini Imerese retains the ancient site as well as name.&lt;ref&gt;Ptol. iii. 4. ? 4; [[Antonine Itinerary|Itin. Ant.]] p.&amp;nbsp;92; [[Tabula Peutingeriana]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The magnificence of the ancient city, and the taste of its citizens for the encouragement of art, are attested by Cicero, who calls it ''in primis Siciliae clarum et ornatum''; and some evidence of it remained, even in the days of that orator, in the statues preserved by the Thermitani, to whom they had been restored by Scipio, after the conquest of Carthage.&lt;ref&gt;Cic. ''Verr.'' ii. 3. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages and modern===

With the fall of the Roman Empire began a period of decadence of the town.  Terme bishop's seat was up to the twelfth century, although the number of bishops has several gaps and uncertainties.  During the domain Norman city became director and later joined the city-owned.  Especially from the Middle Ages until the early nineteenth century was one of the largest centers for collecting and loading of grain and other foodstuffs that were stored and subject to duty in special stores (Royal Charger).  The presence of the shipper had the good fortune of the town that became a major Sicilian port and had intense trade relations with the [[Italian maritime republics]]&lt;ref&gt;Contino &amp; Mantia, 1997.1998, 2001 a, b; 2002nd, b, 2003, 2004, the 2005th, b , c&lt;/ref&gt; of Genoa, Pisa and Venice and the major Mediterranean ports (Marseille, Barcelona etc.) and also in the sixteenth century Atlantic.  At the end of the eighteenth century was the seat of the section of the Ereina Imerese Ereina of Palermo and shortly after Euracea dell'Accademia. In the nineteenth century the closure of Charity Grain was the beginning of a deep economic crisis that narrowed at the end of the century when it developed skills and protoindustriali.  The population decline, mainly related to migration to the Americas, was compensated at the beginning of the twentieth century by immigration from Agrigento, from Messina and Ragusa.

Since 1970, Termini Imerese hosts a large [[Fiat]] automobile manufacturing facility, where Fiat's small cars such as the [[Fiat 126]], the original [[Fiat Panda]] as well as the [[Fiat Punto]] have been manufactured. Since 2005, the plant is the sole assembly site for the [[Lancia Ypsilon]], and in 2006 such a vehicle became the four-millionth one to be produced there.[http://www.samar.pl/__/__la/en/__ac/sec,4/new/9694/__Four-million-cars-manufactured-at-Fiat-Termini-Imerese-plant.html] By the end of 2011, Fiat sold the plant to Chinese car manufacturer Chery &lt;ref&gt;{{Internetquelle | url=http://motoring.asiaone.com/Motoring/News/Story/A1Story20120221-329290.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a power station operated by Enel with a generation capacity of 454 MW.

The archaeological site contains five temples centered on an [[acropolis]]. Of the five temples, only the Temple of Hera, also known as &quot;Temple E&quot;, has been re-erected.

==History==
[[File:Selinos didrachm ANS 685 670331.jpg|thumb|Selinunte [[didrachm]] coin bearing a ''selinon'' (celery) leaf, circa 515?470 BC.]]

Selinunte was one of the most important of the [[ancient Greece|Greek]] colonies in Sicily, situated on the southwest coast of that island, at the mouth of the small river of the same name, and 6.5&amp;nbsp;km west of that of the Hypsas (the modern [[Belice River]]). It was founded, according to historian [[Thucydides]], by a colony from the Sicilian city of Megara, or [[Megara Hyblaea]], under the conduct of a leader named [[Pammilus]], about 100 years after the settlement of that city, with the addition of a fresh body of colonists from the parent city of [[Megara]] in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides vi. 4, vii. 57; [[Scymnus]] 292; [[Strabo]] vi. p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; The date of its foundation cannot be precisely fixed, as Thucydides indicates it only by reference to that of the Sicilian Megara, which is itself not accurately known, but it may be placed about 628 BCE. [[Diodorus]] places it 22 years earlier, or 650 BCE, and [[Hieronymus]] still further back, 654 BCE. The date from Thucydides, which is probably the most likely, is incompatible with this earlier epoch.&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides vi. 4; Diodorus Siculus xiii. 59; Hieronymus ''Chron.'' ad ann. 1362; Clinton, ''Fast. Hell.'' vol. i. p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; The name is supposed to have been derived from quantities of wild [[parsley]] ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|???????}}?''selinon'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dse%2Flinon ???????], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; that grew on the spot. For the same reason, they adopted the parsley leaf as the symbol on their coins.

Selinunte was the most westerly of the Greek colonies in Sicily, and for this reason was early brought into contact and collision with the [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] and the native Sicilians in the west and northwest of the island. The former people, however, do not at first seem to have offered any obstacle to their progress; but as early as 580 BCE we find the Selinuntines engaged in hostilities with the people of [[Segesta]] (a non-Hellenic city), whose territory bordered on their own.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus v. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The arrival of a body of emigrants from [[Rhodes]] and [[Cnidus]] who subsequently founded [[Lipara]], and who lent their assistance to the Segestans, for a time secured the victory to that people; but disputes and hostilities seem to have been of frequent occurrence between the two cities, and it is probable that in 454 BCE, when Diodorus speaks of the Segestans as being at war with the [[Marsala|Lilybaeans]] (modern Marsala),&lt;ref&gt;xi. 86&lt;/ref&gt; that the Selinuntines are the people really meant. The river [[Mazarus]], which at that time appears to have formed the boundary between the two states, was only about 25&amp;nbsp;km west of Selinunte; and it is certain that at a somewhat later period the territory of Selinunte extended to its banks, and that that city had a fort and emporium at its mouth&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus xiii. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other side its territory certainly extended as far as the [[Halycus]] (modern [[Platani]]), at the mouth of which it founded the colony of [[Heraclea Minoa|Minoa]], or Heracleia, as it was afterward termed&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]] v. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; It is evident, therefore, that Selinunte had early attained to great power and prosperity; but we have very little information as to its history. We learn, however, that, like most of the Sicilian cities, it had passed from an oligarchy to a despotism, and about 510 BCE was subject to a despot named [[Peithagoras]], from whom the citizens were freed by the assistance of the [[Sparta]]n [[Euryleon]], one of the companions of [[Dorieus]]: and thereupon Euryleon himself, for a short time, seized on the vacant sovereignty, but was speedily overthrown and put to death by the Selinuntines.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus v. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; The causes leading the Selinuntines to abandon the cause of the other Greeks, and take part with the Carthaginians during the great expedition of [[Hamilcar]] (480 BCE) are unknown; they had even promised to send a contingent to the Carthaginian army, which, however did not arrive till after its defeat&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus xi. 21, xiii. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Selinunte - Tempio E.JPG|thumb|left|&quot;Temple E&quot;]]
The Selinuntines are next mentioned in 466 BCE, as co-operating with the other free cities of Sicily in assisting the [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracusans]] to expel [[Thrasybulus of Syracuse|Thrasybulus]];&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' xi. 68&lt;/ref&gt; and there is every reason to suppose that they fully shared in the prosperity of the half century that followed, a period of tranquility and opulence for most of the Greek cities in Sicily. Thucydides speaks of Selinunte just before the [[Athens|Athenian]] expedition as a powerful and wealthy city, possessing great resources for war both by land and sea, and having large stores of wealth accumulated in its temples.&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides vi. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Diodorus also represents it at the time of the Carthaginian invasion, as having enjoyed a long period of tranquility, and possessing a numerous population.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus xiii. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 416 BCE, a renewal of the old disputes between Selinunte and Segesta became the occasion of the great Athenian expedition to Sicily. The Selinuntines were the first to call in the powerful aid of Syracuse, and thus for a time obtained the complete advantage over their enemies, whom they were able to blockade both by sea and land; but in this extremity the Segestans had recourse to the assistance of Athens.&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides vi. 6; Diodorus Siculus xii. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the Athenians do not appear to have taken any measures for the immediate relief of Segesta, it is probable that the Selinuntines and Syracusans withdrew their forces at once, as we hear no more of their operations against Segesta. Nor does Selinunte bear any important part in the war of which it was the immediate occasion. [[Nicias]] indeed proposed, when the expedition first arrived in Sicily (415 BCE); that they should proceed at once to Selinunte and compel that city to submit on moderate terms;&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides vi. 47&lt;/ref&gt; but this advice being overruled, the efforts of the armament were directed against Syracuse, and the Selinuntines in consequence bore but a secondary part in the subsequent operations. They are, however, mentioned on several occasions as furnishing auxiliaries to the Syracusans; and it was at Selinunte that the large [[Peloponnesia]]n force sent to the support of [[Gylippus]] landed in the spring of 413 BCE, having been driven over to the coast of Africa by a tempest.&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides vii. 50, 58; Diodorus Siculus xiii. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The defeat of the Athenian armament apparently left the Segestans at the mercy of their rivals. They tried in vain to ease Selinuntine hostility by ceding without further contest the frontier district that was the original subject of dispute. The Selinuntines, however, were not satisfied with this concession, and continued to press them with fresh aggressions, leading the Segestans to seek assistance from Carthage. After some hesitation, Carthage sent a small force, with the assistance of which the Segestans defeated the Selinuntines in a battle.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus xiii. 43, 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The Carthaginians in the following spring (409 BCE) sent over a vast army amounting, according to the lowest estimate, to 100,000 men, with which [[Hannibal Mago]] (the grandson of Hamilcar that was killed at [[Himera]]) landed at Lilybaeum, and from thence marched direct to Selinunte. The city's inhabitants had not expected such a force and were wholly unprepared to resist it. The city fortifications were, in many places, in disrepair, and the auxiliary force promised by Syracuse and Agrigentum (modern [[Agrigento]]) and [[Gela]], was not ready and did not arrive in time. The Selinuntines defended themselves with the courage of despair, and even after the walls were breached, continued the contest from house to house. However, the enemy's overwhelming numbers rendered resistance hopeless, and after a ten-day siege the city was taken and most of the defenders put to the sword. According to sources, of the citizens of Selinunte 16,000 were slain, 5,000 made prisoners, and 2,600 under the command of [[Empedion]] escaped to Agrigentum.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus xiii. 54-59.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, Hannibal destroyed the city walls, but gave permission to the surviving inhabitants to return and occupy it as tributaries of Carthage, an arrangement confirmed by the treaty subsequently concluded between [[Dionysius I of Syracuse|Dionysius]], tyrant of Syracuse, and the Carthaginians, in 405 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' xiii. 59, 114.&lt;/ref&gt; In the interval a considerable number of the survivors and fugitives had been brought together by [[Hermocrates]], and established within its walls.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' 63.&lt;/ref&gt; A considerable part of the citizens of Selinunte availed themselves of this permission, and that the city continued to subsist under the Carthaginian dominion; but a fatal blow had been given to its prosperity, which it undoubtedly never recovered.

The Selinuntines are again mentioned in 397 BCE as declaring in favor of Dionysius during his war with Carthage;&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus xiv. 47&lt;/ref&gt; but both the city and territory were again given up to the Carthaginians by the peace of 383 BCE (''Id.'' xv. 17); and though Dionysius recovered possession of it by arms shortly before his death,&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' xv. 73&lt;/ref&gt; it is probable that it soon again lapsed under the dominion of Carthage. The Halycus, which was established as the eastern boundary of the Carthaginian dominion in Sicily by the treaty of 383 BCE, seems to have generally continued to be so recognized, notwithstanding temporary interruptions; and was again fixed as their limit by the treaty with [[Agathocles]] in 314 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' xix. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; This last treaty expressly stipulated that Selinunte, as well as Heracleia and Himera, should continue subject to Carthage, as before. In 276 BCE, however, during the expedition of [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]] to Sicily, the Selinuntines voluntarily submitted to that monarch, after the capture of Heracleia.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' xxii. 10. Exc. H. p. 498.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[First Punic War]] we again find Selinunte subject to Carthage, and its territory was repeatedly the theater of military operations between the contending powers.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' xxiii. 1, 21; [[Polybius]] i. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; But before the close of the war (about 250 BCE), when the Carthaginians were beginning to contract their operations, and confine themselves to the defense of as few points as possible, they removed all the inhabitants of Selinunte to Lilybaeum and destroyed the city&lt;ref&gt;Diod. xxiv. 1. Exc. H. p. 506.&lt;/ref&gt;

It seems certain that it was never rebuilt. [[Pliny the Elder]] indeed, mentions its name (''Selinus oppidum''&lt;ref&gt;iii. 8. s. 14&lt;/ref&gt;), as if it still existed as a town in his time, but [[Strabo]] distinctly classes it with extinct cities. [[Ptolemy]], though he mentions the river Selinus, has no notice of a town of the name.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo vi. p. 272; Ptolemy iii. 4. ? 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The Thermae Selinuntiae (at modern [[Sciacca]]), which derived their name from the ancient city, and seem to have been much frequented in the time of the [[ancient Rome|Romans]], were situated at a considerable distance, 30&amp;nbsp;km, from Selinunte: they are sulfurous springs, still much valued for their medical properties, and dedicated, like most thermal waters in Sicily, to San Calogero. At a later period they were called the Aquae Labodes or Larodes, under which name they appear in the Itineraries.&lt;ref&gt;[[Antonine Itinerary]] p. 89; [[Tabula Peutingeriana]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern situation and ruins==
[[File:Koldewey-Sicilien-vol2-table15-detail01.png|thumb|Ground floor of Temple A (ca. 480 BC). The remains of the two spiral stairs between the [[pronaos]] and the [[cella]] are the oldest known to date (see [[List of ancient spiral stairs]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Temple A&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Beckmann|2002|p=354}}; {{harvnb|Ruggeri|2006|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

By the 19th century, the site of the ancient city was wholly desolate, with the exception of a solitary guardhouse, and the ground for the most part thickly overgrown with shrubs and low brushwood; but the remains of the walls could be distinctly traced throughout a great part of their circuit. They occupied the summit of a low hill, directly abutting on the sea, and bounded on the west by the marshy valley through which flows the river [[Madiuni]], the ancient Selinus; on the east by a smaller valley or depression, also traversed by a small marshy stream, which separates it from a hill of similar character, where the remains of the principal temples are still visible. The space enclosed by the existing walls is of small extent, so that it is probable the city in the days of its greatness must have covered a considerable area without them: and it has been supposed by some writers that the present line of walls is that erected by Hermocrates when he restored the city after its destruction by the Carthaginians.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus xiii. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; No trace is, however, found of a more extensive circuit, though the remains of two lines of wall, evidently connected with the port, are found in the small valley east of the city. Within the area surrounded by the walls are the remains of three temples, all of the [[Doric order]], and of an ancient style; none of them were standing until the temple designated &quot;Temple E&quot; was re-erected in the 20th century, but the foundations of them all remain, together with numerous portions of columns and other architectural fragments, sufficient to enable one to restore the plan and design of all three without difficulty. The largest of them is 70 m long by 25 m broad, and has 6 columns in front and 18 in length, a very unusual proportion. All these are [[hexastyle]] and [[peripteral]]. Besides these three temples there is a small temple or [[Aedicula]], of a different plan, but also of the Doric order. No other remains of buildings, beyond mere fragments and foundations, can be traced within the walls; but the outlines of two large edifices, built of squared stones and in a massive style, are distinctly traceable outside the walls, near the northeast and northwest angles of the city, though their nature or purpose is unclear.

But much the most remarkable of the ruins at Selinus are those of three temples on the hill to the east, which do not appear to have been included in the city, but, as was often the case, were built on this neighboring eminence, so as to front the city itself. All these temples are considerably larger than any of the three above described; and the most northerly of them is one of the largest of which we have any remains. It had 8 columns in front and 17 in the sides, and was of the kind called pseudo-dipteral. Its length was 110 m, and its breadth 55 m, so that it was actually longer than the great [[Temple of Olympian Zeus (Agrigento)|Temple of Olympian Zeus]] at Agrigentum, though not equal to it in breadth. From the columns being only partially fluted, as well as from other signs, it is clear that it never was completed; but all the more important parts of the structure were finished, and it must have certainly been one of the most imposing fabrics in antiquity. Only three of the columns are now standing, and these imperfect; but the whole area is filled up with a heap of fallen masses, portions of columns, capitals, and other huge architectural fragments, all of the most massive character, and forming, as observed by [[Henry Swinburne]], one of the most gigantic and sublime ruins imaginable. The two other temples are also prostrate, but the ruins have fallen with such regularity that the portions of almost every column lie on the ground as they have fallen; and it is not only easy to restore the plan and design of the two edifices, but it appears as if they could be rebuilt with little difficulty.

The southernmost of the three temples, the Temple of Hera, also known as &quot;Temple E,&quot; was reconstructed in the 20th century, as may be seen in the photographs below. A 1st century BC Greek inscription on the building records its dedication to Hera.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Spawforth, ''The Complete Greek Temples'' 2006, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

These temples, though greatly inferior to their gigantic neighbor, were still larger than that at Segesta, and even exceed the great temple of Neptune at [[Paestum]]; so that the three, when standing, must have presented a spectacle unrivaled in antiquity. All these buildings may be safely referred to a period anterior to the Carthaginian conquest (409 BCE), though the three temples last described appear to have been all of them of later date than those within the walls of the city. This is proved, among other circumstances, by the sculptured [[Metope (architecture)|metopes]], several of which have been discovered and extricated from among the fallen fragments. Those of these sculptures that belonged to the temples within the walls, present a peculiar and archaic style of art, and are universally recognized as among the earliest extant specimens of Greek sculpture&lt;ref&gt;They are figured by M?ller, ''Denkm?ler'', pl. 4, 5, as well as in many other works, and casts of them are in the [[British Museum]].&lt;/ref&gt; Those, on the contrary, which have been found among the ruins of the temple on the opposite hill, are of a later and more advanced style, though still retaining considerable remains of the stiffness of the earliest art. Besides the interest attached to these Selinuntine metopes from their important bearing on the history of Greek sculpture, the remains of these temples are of value as affording the most unequivocal testimony to the use of painting, both for the architectural decoration of the temples, and as applied to the sculptures with which they were adorned.

==Coinage==
The coins of Selinus are numerous and various. The earliest, as already mentioned, bear merely the figure of a parsley-leaf on the obverse. Those of somewhat later date represent a figure sacrificing on an altar, which is consecrated to [[Aesculapius]], as indicated by a cock that stands below it. The subject of this type evidently refers to a story related by [[Diogenes Laertius]]&lt;ref&gt;viii. 2. ? 11&lt;/ref&gt; that the Selinuntines were afflicted with a pestilence from the marshy character of the lands adjoining the neighboring river, but that this was cured by works of drainage, suggested by [[Empedocles]]. A figure standing on some coins is the river-god Selinus, who was thus made conducive to the salubrity of the city.

==How to get to Selinunte==

Highway A29 (Free) Palermo-Mazara del Vallo, exit Castelvetrano continuation Selinunte.

[[Trapani-Birgi Airport]], a military-civilian airport (with flights to the third traffic island). Recently the airport has seen an increase in flights due to low-cost flights from all parts of Europe (e.g. London-Stansted and London Luton Airport, Paris Beauvais, Dublin, Brussels, Munich, Frankfurt, Eindhoven, Stockholm).

{{About|the ancient city of Utica in Tunisia|other places with this name|Utica (disambiguation)}}[[File:TUNISIE UTIQUE 05.JPG|thumb|The ruins of Utica]]'''Utica''' ({{IPA-en|?jut?k?}}) is an ancient city northwest of [[Carthage]] near the outflow of the [[Medjerda River]] into the [[Mediterranean Sea]], traditionally considered to be the first colony founded by the Phoenicians in North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Moscati, Sabatino. ''The World of the Phoenicians.'' New York: Frederick A. Praeger, Publishers, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, Utica no longer exists, and its remains are located not on the coast where it once lay, but further inland because deforestation and agriculture upriver led to massive erosion and the Medjerda River silted over its original mouth.&lt;ref&gt;?Utica (Utique) Tunisia&quot;.  The Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites. Stillwell, Richard, Macdonald, William L. and McAllister, Marian Holland. Princeton, N.J: Princeton University Press, 1976. 5 May 2007.  &lt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0006%3Aid%3Dutica&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Utica&quot; is from the Phoenician ''?attiq'' (identical to modern Arabic ??????? and Hebrew ????) meaning &quot;old [town]&quot;, contrasting with the later colony &quot;Carthage&quot;, meaning &quot;new town&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=91YymsCw5DIC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;lpg=PA102&amp;dq=phoenician+%22old+town%22+utica&amp;source=web&amp;ots=sekC16vr4u&amp;sig=WKww_T6bMUOiMfL9x3LbtnGHlUo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;????????, &quot;????????&quot; (Polybius, &quot;Historiae&quot;, translated by: Beyamin Shimron [?????? ??????]; Bialik institute, Jerusalem 1991)p. 102, n. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Utica's beginnings===
Utica was founded as a port located on the trade route leading to the Straits of Gibraltar and the Atlantic, thus facilitating [[Phoenicia]]n trade in the Mediterranean.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aubet, Maria Eugenia 2001&quot;&gt;Aubet, Maria Eugenia. ''The Phoenicians and the West, Politics, Colonies, and Trade.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  The actual founding date of Utica is controversial. Several classical authors date its foundation around 1100 BC. The archaeological evidence, however, suggests a foundation no earlier than the eighth century BC. Although Carthage was later founded about 40&amp;nbsp;km. from Utica, records suggest ?that until 540 BC Utica was still maintaining political and economic autonomy in relation to its powerful Carthaginian neighbor?.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aubet, Maria Eugenia 2001&quot;/&gt;  By the fourth century BC, Utica came under Punic control but continued to exist as a privileged ally of Carthage.&lt;ref&gt;[[F. W. Walbank|Walbank, F. W.]], Astin, A.E., Frederiksen, M.W., Ogilvie R.M. and Drummond, A., eds. ''The Rise of Rome to 220 BC.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989. Vol. VII of The Cambridge Ancient History.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mercenary War===
This relationship between Carthage and Utica began to disintegrate after the [[First Punic War]], with the [[Mercenary War|outbreak of rebellion among mercenaries]] who had not received compensation for their service to Carthage. Originally, Utica refused to participate in this rebellion, so that the Libyan forces led by Spendius and Matho laid siege to Utica and nearby Hippocritae.&lt;ref&gt;Polybius.  ?The Histories.? Book 1. Loeb Classical Library. Vol I. 2 May 2007. &lt;http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/1*.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The Carthaginian generals [[Hanno]] and [[Hamilcar]] then came to Utica's defense, managing to raise the siege, but &quot;the severest blow of all? was the defection of Hippacritae and Utica, the only two cities in [[Libya]] which had?bravely faced the present war?indeed they never had on any occasion given the least sign of hostility to Carthage.?  &lt;ref&gt;Polybius.  ?The Histories.? Book 1. Loeb Classical Library. Vol I. 2 May 2007. &lt;http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/1*.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually, the forces of Carthage proved victorious, forcing Utica and Hippacritae to surrender after a short siege.&lt;ref&gt;Walbank, F.W., Astin, A.E., Frederiksen, M.W., Ogilvie R.M. and Drummond, A., eds. ''The Rise of Rome to 220 BC.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989. Vol. VII of The Cambridge Ancient History.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third Punic War===
Utica again defied Carthage in the [[Third Punic War]], when it surrendered to Rome shortly before the breakout of war in 150 BC. After its victory, Rome rewarded Utica by granting it an expanse of territory stretching from Carthage to [[Hippo Regius|Hippo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Walbank, F.W. 1989&quot;&gt;Walbank, F.W., Astin, A.E., Frederiksen, M.W., and Ogilvie R.M., eds. ''Rome and the Mediterranean to 133 BC.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989. Vol. VIII of The Cambridge Ancient History.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the war, Rome created a new province of [[Roman North Africa|Africa]], and Utica became its capital, which meant that the governor's residence was there along with a small garrison. Over the following decades Utica also attracted Roman citizens who settled there to do business.&lt;ref&gt;?Utica (Utique) Tunisia&quot;.  The Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites. Stillwell, Richard, Macdonald, William L. and McAllister, Marian Holland. Princeton, N.J: Princeton University Press, 1976. 5 May 2007.  &lt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0006%3Aid%3Dutica&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Civil War===
During the [[Caesar's civil war|Roman Civil War]] between the supporters of [[Pompey]] and [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], the remaining Pompeians, including [[Cato the Younger]], fled to Utica after being defeated at the [[Battle of Thapsus]] in 46 BC. Caesar pursued them to Utica, meeting no resistance from the inhabitants. Cato, who was the leader of the Pompeians, ensured the escape of his fellow senators and anyone else who desired to leave, then committed suicide, unwilling to accept the clemency of Caesar.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walbank, F.W. 1989&quot;/&gt;  Displaying their fondness for Cato, ?the people of Utica...called Cato their saviour and benefactor... And this they continued to do even when word was brought that Caesar was approaching. They decked his body in splendid fashion, gave it an illustrious escort, and buried it near the sea, where a statue of him now stands, sword in hand?.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch.  ?The Parallel Lives.?  Loeb Classical Library. Vol VIII. 2 May 2007. &lt;http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cato_Minor*.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  After his death, Cato was given the name of Uticensis, due to the place of his death as well as to his public glorification and burial by the citizens of Utica.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio.  ?Roman History.? Book 43. Loeb Classical Library. Vol IV 2 May 2007. &lt;http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/43*.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman status===
Utica obtained the formal status of a [[municipium]] in 36 BC and its inhabitants became members of the tribe of Quirina.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Utica (Utique) Tunisia&quot;.  The Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites. Stillwell, Richard, Macdonald, William L. and McAllister, Marian Holland. Princeton, N.J: Princeton University Press, 1976. 5 May 2007.  &lt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0006%3Aid%3Dutica&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; During the reign of [[Augustus]], however, the seat of provincial government was moved to Carthage, although Utica did not lose its status as one of the foremost cities in the province. When [[Hadrian]] was emperor, Utica requested to become a full Roman colony, but this request was not granted until [[Septimius Severus]], a native of the Province of Africa, took the throne.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bunson, Matthew. ?Utica.? Encyclopedia of the Roman Empire. New York: Facts on File, Inc., 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The fall of Utica===
In AD 439, the [[Vandals]] captured Utica, in AD 534 the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] captured it once more, and the Arabs were responsible for its ultimate destruction around AD 700.  &quot;Excavations at the site have yielded two Punic cemeteries and Roman ruins, including baths and a villa with mosaics&quot;.
&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Utica, Ancient City, N Africa&quot;. Columbia Encyclopedia. Academic Search Premier. EBSCOhost. Northwestern University Library. 1 May 2007.  &lt;http://web.ebscohost.com.turing.library.northwestern.edu/ehost/detail?vid=4&amp;hid=8&amp;sid=275d98f6-98aa-4c9b-8592-907b38a2c47c%40sessionmgr8&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ruins==
The site of the ruins of Utica is set on a low hill, composed of several Roman villas. Their walls still preserve decorative floor mosaics. To the northwest of these villas is a Punic necropolis, with Punic sarcophagi 20 feet (6meters) below the Roman level.

'''Jean Emile Humbert''' (28 July 1771, [[The Hague]] - 20 February 1839, [[Livorno]]) was a Dutch lieutenant-colonel who can be credited with rediscovering ancient [[Carthage]]. As an agent for the Dutch government he procured vital parts of the collection of the [[Rijksmuseum van Oudheden|National Museum of Antiquities]] in [[Leiden]]. Humbert was awarded the [[Order of the Netherlands Lion]] for his [[Archaeology|archaeological]] work.==1796 to 1821==
Humbert was a son of [[Jean Humbert (painter)|Jean Humbert]], a Dutch painter of Swiss and French extraction. His brother [[David Pierre Giottino Humbert de Superville]] was a well-known artist and scholar.

As an officer in the army of the [[Dutch Republic]] he was faced with the political unrest of the [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] era. When in 1795 the Dutch Republic was transformed by revolutionaries into the [[Batavian Republic]], Humbert refused to serve the new state and found his way to an engineering project in [[Tunisia]].

In North Africa Humbert stayed with [[Antoine Nijssen]], the Dutch consul for Tunisia. Humbert fell in love with the consul's daughter, Th?r?se, and would marry her in 1801. During these years the new harbour for [[Tunis]] was built, and when the commanding officer of the project left the country for good, Humbert took charge.

During his lengthy stay in Tunisia, Humbert became fascinated with the [[History of Tunesia|history of the country]]. He started collecting antiquities, and began compiling notes about the history, customs and [[Languages of Tunesia|language of Tunisia]]. He took a special interest in the peninsula near Tunis where the ancient city of Carthage had once been. Although the location of Roman Carthage was known, the exact location of Punic Carthage was a matter of dispute. After the [[Third Punic War]] the Romans had completely destroyed the site. When a century later a new Roman colony was built, all Punic remains would be swamped in the later architecture. Humbert studied the area, drew an accurate map and escorted many travelers who visited the area. This led to him becoming an expert on the topography of the ancient site.

In 1817 Humbert made a monumental discovery when a plowing farmer stumbled upon four Punic [[stela]]e and two fragments with Punic inscriptions on them. These were the first complete Carthaginian remains discovered since antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Halbertsma, R. B. (2003). ''Scholars, Travellers, and Trade: The Pioneer Years of the National Museum of Antiquities in Leiden, 1818-1840'', Routledge, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; In 1821, already back in the Netherlands, Humbert would publish the finds.

Now that the Batavian Republic had collapsed and was replaced with the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], Humbert could return to his homeland. While he was gone, disaster would strike in his household back in Tunisia. Humbert's daughter and son-in-law died because of the [[plague (disease)|plague]] and his house had to be burned down. Humbert and his wife had not only lost their loved ones, but were financially devastated as well.

When returning to the Netherlands, Humbert hoped to get his new assignment to the Indies overturned. He also tried to sell his remaining possessions, most notably his collection of antiquities. Through his contacts he met with [[archaeology]] professor [[Caspar Reuvens]]. Reuvens would prove to be enthusiastic about Humbert's knowledge of ancient Carthage, and welcomed the collection of antiquities. He valued the artefacts at 17,000 [[guilder]]s. Humbert's assignment in the Indies was changed into a major's pension without assignment, so that Humbert was now free to work on archaeological projects.

==First archaeological expedition==
Between 1822 and 1824 Humbert would go on his first archaeological expedition for the Dutch government. Reuvens wished to publish about Carthage, and with that be the first to do a serious large scale study about the city. He repeatedly noted how Carthage had been of huge importance in antiquity, but was not yet studied in modernity. Humbert was asked to conduct excavations at Carthage, buy antiquities unearthed at nearby [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]], collect Punic material and work on plans, drawings and sketches.

The Dutch Department of Education, Arts and Sciences arranged for the expedition and financed it. Humbert received an increase in his pension, and was given funds for the excavations and purchases. At this time Humbert was awarded with the [[Order of the Netherlands Lion]], both as a reward for his troubles and in order to impress the Tunisians.

After securing a positive relationship with the ruler in Tunis, Humbert set his mind on the purchase of nine sculptures discovered at Utica. Unfortunately a top piece in the group was sold and shipped to Denmark, but Humbert managed to procure the other eight statues. These still form an essential part of the current collection in Leiden, at the [[Rijksmuseum van Oudheden|National Museum of Antiquities]].

Humbert continued to collect antiquities and went on to conduct numerous excavations. All of these excavations were small though, the longest one lasting only two weeks. Though there certainly were finds, none of the artifacts were very special. Most notable about these excavations is the level of precision with which Humbert conducted them, making notes and impressive drawings.&lt;ref&gt;Halbertsma, R. B. (2003). ''Scholars, Travellers, and Trade: The Pioneer Years of the National Museum of Antiquities in Leiden, 1818-1840'', Routledge, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon returning to the Netherlands late 1824, Humbert delivered sixty-five crates full of art and artifacts. Professor Reuvens was pleased with the additions to the collection, but wanted a second expedition.

==Second archaeological expedition==
Humbert was not at all happy to have to return to Tunisia. During the last expedition he had become increasingly depressed with the work and climate. He hoped to remain closer to home, or at least not return to the North African coast. Egypt was monopolized by France and England however, and colonel Rottiers was already working in Greece (see [[Rottiers Collection]]).
Reuvens won out, arguing that Humbert knew the area the best and that much more research into the Carthaginian peninsula was needed. In the summer of 1825 a royal decree decided on a second expedition, lasting four years. Humbert was at this point promoted to lieutenant-colonel.

===Etruscan antiquities===
Humbert traveled to [[Italy]] from where he would take a ship to Tunisia. Arriving in the spring of 1826 however, Humbert argued that the summer in Tunisia would be too hot to excavate. Combining that argument with the raging anti-Christian sentiments among the Tunisians, Humbert persuaded Reuvens to allow him a delay of four months. Staying in [[Livorno]], he began collecting Etruscan antiquities and soon bought six urns.

These six urns would cause some commotion because Etruscan art was hardly known outside Italy at that point.&lt;ref&gt;Halbertsma, R. B. (2003). ''Scholars, Travellers, and Trade: The Pioneer Years of the National Museum of Antiquities in Leiden, 1818-1840'', Routledge, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; Reuvens judged three of them to be fake, and had serious doubts about one. Humbert was not very happy with this verdict, being sure himself that the six urns were all genuine. He responded by composing a dossier about the discovery of the urns, and enlisted the aid of Italian archaeologists. Humbert had numerous compelling arguments and even proposed to ship the urns back to Italy for a public debate. The relationship between Reuvens and Humbert was considerably cooler for a while as a result of this incident, though eventually their friendship returned. Humbert would buy more urns, this time all with certificates of authenticity.

An important opportunity came when a large collection of Etruscan antiquities was offered for sale. The collection was known as the Museo Corazzi, and consisted of over 500 artifacts. Most of these were bronzes and Etruscan. Reuvens was interested in the Corazzi collection, because the study of the relatively unknown Etruscans could push Italian history back considerably.&lt;ref&gt;Halbertsma, R. B. (2003). ''Scholars, Travellers, and Trade: The Pioneer Years of the National Museum of Antiquities in Leiden, 1818-1840'', Routledge, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Taxating the group proved difficult though, since there were no masterpieces but Etruscan art was rare. The requested price for the collection had dropped from 60.000 guilders to 38.000, but this was still a huge amount of money and Etruscan antiquities lay outside the scope of the expedition which was supposed to be in Tunisia.

The decision to buy or not was left to the Dutch government, where discussion and correspondence took place between the king, various ministers and professor Reuvens. Financial difficulties in the Corazzi family led to the collection being offered for 5.000 guilders less, and Humbert boldly sealed the deal without permission to buy. Making clear that this was not the way things were supposed to go, the Dutch government permitted the buy after it was in fact made. The deal was not regretted, for the collection started Etruscan studies in the Netherlands{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}.
Humbert around this time also bought a smaller collection of Roman, Egyptian and Punic antiquities, and shipped everything to the Netherlands.

===Egyptian antiquities===
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2011}}
Humbert still remained in Livorno and did not cross to the destination of his second expedition, Tunisia. After considerably adding to the museums collection through buying the Etruscan antiquities, Humbert would again add an impressive amount of artifacts to the National Museum of Antiquities.

Maria Cimba, a widow, offered the Egyptian collection of her deceased husband for 14.000 guilders. Humbert had permission to offer 8.000 guilders, but someone else offerend 9.000 and the collection was sold. The other buyer could not assemble the money in time though, and Humbert managed to buy the collection for a mere 5.000 guilders. 335 Egyptian pieces were now owned by the Dutch.

A while after the purchase of the Cimba collection, a much more impressive group of Egyptian pieces was offered for sale. The more than 5600 artifacts were owned by Jean d'Anasty, a very wealthy merchant of good reputation. Humbert inspected the impressive collection and sent Reuvens the catalogue of over 110 pages. Reuvens enlisted the aid of the Dutch ambassador in Rome. The enormous amount of 200,000 guilders was asked for this collection, and negotiations would be intense.

Reuvens tried to evaluate the worth of the collection by comparing it to other large recently sold collections. Though the statues of the Anasty collection were not very impressive, there were some mummies and especially the large amount of papyri made the collection worth having. The Dutch opening bids of 50.000 guilders and then 70.000 were angrily rejected, and a representative was sent to the Netherlands to speak with Reuvens. It was clear that the negotiations were beyond Humbert at this point. Humbert was not happy with the way things were going, and thought Reuvens' taxation was much too low. Reuvens had meanwhile upgraded his estimation of the value.

In February 1828 Humbert offered the maximum he was allowed to offer, 200.000 francs or roughly 100,000 guilders. It would be yet another offer rejected out of hand, although by this time the asking price had been lowered to 300.000 francs and some objects were added to the collection.
Reuvens at this point thought that 150.000 guilders, or 300.000 francs, was a fair price. The king was not pleased however. 300.000 francs was too much to spend on antiquities, and an official maximum was set on 230.000 francs. Bypassing the consul in Rome, news of this was sent directly to Humbert who made the offer. Prospects were bleak, and no-one expected that the collection would be sold for the rough equivalent of 115.000 guilders. It is a mystery why, but Anasty accepted the offer and after a year of intense negotiations the collection was in the hands of the Dutch government.

On the first day of 1829 the antiquities arrived in Leiden, and Humbert received another three items as a gift by d'Anasty. These items were offered by d'Anasty before the deal was closed, but had been kept secret by his agents in Italy. Humbert was told of it by one of them though, and confronted the other one. A Byzantine helmet, a Greek manuscript and a Greek-Demotic bilingual papyrus were added to the collection.

The second Egyptian acquisition would be the largest sum the government would ever pay, and was the largest deal of Humberts career. There remained one and a half year of time set for the expedition though. Professor Reuvens at this point understood that Humbert had no serious plans to go to North Africa and hoped to make use of Humbert as an agent in Italy. He made a few more minor purchases and returned to the Netherlands early in the 1830s.

==Life after the expeditions==
Humbert returned to the Netherlands and began working on a publication about Carthage, trying to decipher the notes of the deceased Borgia. No plans of a third expedition ever came near to success however, and Humbert decided to return to Italy to live on his military pension. He would return once more to the Netherlands, but by that time was a sickly man. In 1839 Humbert died in Italy, bequeathing his private collection of antiquities to the Leiden museum. His gravestone claims the discovery of Carthage.

{{Unreferenced|date=November 2010}}[[Image:PW2 Rhone 218BC.PNG|right|thumb|330px|Map of the western Mediterranean and Carthaginian Iberia in 218BC]]The [[History of Carthage|Carthaginian]] presence in [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] lasted from 575 BC to 206 BC when the Carthaginians were defeated at the [[Battle of Ilipa]] in the [[Second Punic War]].

==Background==
[[File:PhoenicianTrade.png|thumb|left|Phoenician trade routes]]
The [[Phoenicia]]ns were a people from the eastern [[Mediterranean]] who were mainly traders from the cities of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], [[Sidon]], and [[Byblos]]. They colonised much of the Mediterranean and in the year 814 BC, they founded the city of [[Carthage]]. After the fall of [[Phoenicia]] to the [[Babylon]]ians and [[Persia]]ns, Carthage became the most powerful Phoenician colony in the Mediterranean and the Carthaginians annexed many of the other Phoenician colonies around the coast of the western Mediterranean, such as [[Hadrumetum]] and [[Thapsus]]. They also annexed territory in [[Sicily]], [[Africa]], [[Sardinia]] and in 575 BC, they created colonies on the Iberian peninsula.

==Expansion into Iberia==
After the defeat of Carthage in the [[First Punic War]], the Carthaginian general [[Hamilcar Barca]] crushed a mercenary revolt in Africa and trained a new army consisting of [[Numidians]] along with mercenaries and other infantry and in 236 BC, he led an expedition to Iberia where he hoped to gain a new empire for Carthage to compensate for the territories that had been lost in the recent conflicts with [[Roman Republic|Rome]] and to serve as a base for vengeance against the Romans.

In eight years, by force of arms and diplomacy, he secured an extensive territory in [[Hispania]], but his premature death in battle (228 BC) prevented him from completing the conquest.

==Fall of the Empire==
The fall of Carthage's Iberian territories came in the Second Punic War.
In the year 209, after the Romans had landed on Iberia under the command
of [[Scipio Africanus]], they captured the centre of Punic power in Iberia, Cartagena.
They then moved south and faced the Punic army of Hasdrubal in the [[Battle of Baecula]] but were not able to prevent him from continuing his march to Italy in order to reinforce his brother Hannibal. This catastrophic defeat sealed the fate of the Carthaginian presence in Iberia. It was followed by the Roman capture of [[Gades]] in 206 BC after the city had already rebelled against Carthaginian rule. A last attempt was made by Mago in 205 BC to recapture New Carthage while the Roman presence was shaken by a mutiny and an Iberian uprising against their new overlords. But the attack was repulsed. So in the same year he left Iberia, setting sail from the Balearic islands to Italy with his remaining forces.

==Art and artefacts of Phoenician influence in Celt-Iberia==
Four Celto-Iberian &quot;Ladies&quot;: [[Dama del Cerro de los Santos|Lady of Cerro de los Santos]], [[Lady of Baza]], [[Lady of Guardamar]], and [[Lady of Elche]], are dated around 4th century BCE.

The Lady of Guardamar, found in 1987, is in the Museum of Alicante. When the Lady of Elche was found, it was thought to be of Hellenic influence, but since the discovery of the Guardamar Lady in 1987, in the [[Phoenician]] ([[Carthaginian]]) site of Guardamar near [[Alicante]] ([[Lucentum]]), Phoenician would seem to be the appropriate designation.

This series of sculptures can be seen as types of funerary urns to hold ashes. There has been speculation that the Elche bust was originally full-length.  Mythological animals of an earlier period ? 6th-5th century BC: the [[Bull of Osuna]], the [[Sphinx of Agost]] and the [[Biche of Balazote]], are in the Archaeological Museum of Madrid.

{{Campaignbox Byzantine-Arab Wars}}

The '''Battle of Carthage''' was fought in [[698]] AD between a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] expeditionary force and the armies of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]]. Having lost Carthage to the [[Muslim]]s,  Emperor [[Leontius]] sent the navy under the command of John the Patrician and the ''[[droungarios]]'' Tiberius Apsimarus. They entered the harbor and successfully recaptured it, as well as the city, in a stunning surprise attack. The Arab forces fled to [[Kairouan]]. As [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]] writes, &quot;the Christians landed; the citizens hailed the ensign of the cross, and the winter was idly wasted in the dream of victory or deliverance.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

The emir [[Hasan ibn al-Nu'man]] was in the midst of pacifying the lands of Tamazgh (as it is called by the indigenous peoples)[[{{TALKPAGENAME}}|&lt;sup&gt;idg. when?&lt;/sup&gt;]] or [[Maghreb]] (Arabic for ''the west''), but withdrew from campaigning in the field to confront the renewed [[Byzantine Empire|Roman]] challenge to the emerging caliphate. At [[Kairouan]], he began plans to retake [[Carthage]] the following spring.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}  It is estimated that he headed a force of 40,000 men.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}  The Romans sent out a call for help to their traditional allies, the native [[Amazigh]], and even to their enemies the [[Visigoths]] and the [[Franks]]. Despite having retaken the city[[{{TALKPAGENAME}}|&lt;sup&gt;re-taken?&lt;/sup&gt;]], the Romans were in disarray due to the bitter in-fighting that characterized [[medieval]] [[Byzantine Empire|Romania]] and sapped much of its strength.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}{{Or|date=April 2008}} The previous exarch Gennadius had been a traitor to the Christian cause, defecting to the Muslims and becoming their [[vassal]].  The king of the Visigoths, [[Witiza]], sent a reputed force of 500 warriors in order to help defend Carthage, perhaps to help check the rising Muslim threat which was lopping off large chunks of the [[Roman Empire]], so close to [[Visigoth]]ic [[Hispania]].{{Or|date=April 2008}}[[{{TALKPAGENAME}}|&lt;sup&gt;perhaps?&lt;/sup&gt;]]

[[Hasan ibn al-Nu'man]], enraged at having to retake a city that had not resisted the Roman take over, offered no terms except to surrender or die.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}  The emperor [[Leontius]], infamous for his harsh reaction to failure, had also given his forces instructions of victory or death. The Romans did sally forth and brought battle to the [[Arabs]] directly, but were defeated. They later preferred to continue to incite revolt through the [[Amazigh]] princes.  The Roman commander, John, decided to wait out the siege behind the walls of [[Carthage]] and let the [[Arabs]] exhaust themselves, since he could continue to be resupplied from the sea.  The defenders were faced with Hasan's overwhelming force deployed in ferocious attacks as his men continuously tried to scale the walls with ladders. The Arabs combined their land assault with an attack from the sea that caused John and Apsimarus to fear being trapped within the city.  Yet, the determination of the defenders resulted in the second and final great destruction of Carthage. The Romans retreated to the islands of [[Corsica]], [[Sicily]] and [[Crete]] to further resist Muslim expansion and await the emperor's wrath.

== Aftermath ==

John the Patrician was later murdered after a conspiracy at the hands of his co-commander, Tiberius Apsimarus. Tiberius Apsimarus then, instead of taking the step of returning to [[Africa]] to fight the Muslims, sailed instead to [[Constantinople]]. After a successful rebellion he rose to the throne as [[Tiberius III]], and was later deposed by former emperor [[Justinian II]], now known as the Rhinotmetus.

The conquest of North Africa by the forces of [[Islam]] was now nearly complete. [[Hasan ibn al-Nu'man]] was triumphant. Hasan met with trouble from the Zenata tribe of [[Berber people|Berbers]] under [[al-Kahina]]. They inflicted a serious defeat on him and drove him back to [[Barqa]]. However, in [[702]] AD Caliph [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] strongly reinforced him. Now with a large army and the support of the settled population of [[North Africa]], Hasan pushed forward. He decisively defeated [[al-Kahina]] in the [[Battle of Tabarka]], 85 miles (136&amp;nbsp;km) west of [[Carthage]]. He then developed the village of [[Tunis]], ten miles from the destroyed Carthage. Around [[705]] AD, [[Musa ibn Nusayr]] replaced Hasan. He pacified much of North Africa.

'''Pantelleria''' ({{lang-scn|Pantiddir?a}}), the ancient ''Cossyra'', is an [[Italy|Italian]] [[island]] in the [[Strait of Sicily]] in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], {{convert|100|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} southwest of [[Sicily]] and just {{convert|60|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} east of the [[Tunisia]]n coast. Administratively Pantelleria is a ''[[comune]]'' belonging to the Sicilian [[province of Trapani]]. With an area of {{convert|83|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, it is the largest volcanic satellite island of Sicily.

== Geology ==

[[Image:Pantelleria map.png|thumb|left|upright|Location of Pantelleria]]

The island of Pantelleria is located above a drowned continental rift in the [[Strait of Sicily]] and has been the locus of intensive volcano-tectonic activity.  The 15-km-long ({{convert|15|km|mi|1|disp=output only}}) island is the emergent summit of a largely submarine edifice.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.volcano.si.edu/world/volcano.cfm?vnum=0101-071&lt;/ref&gt;  Two large [[Pleistocene]] [[caldera]]s dominate the island, the older of the two formed about 114,000 years ago and the younger, Cinque Denti caldera formed about 45,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Several vents are located on three sides of the uplifted Montagna Grande block on the southeast side of the island. A submarine eruption in 1891 from a vent off the northwest coast is the only confirmed historical activity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.volcano.si.edu/world/volcano.cfm?vnum=0101-071&amp;volpage=erupt&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently the island is undergoing a period of deflation, and Montagna Grande is slowly sinking. This is thought to be caused by the magma beneath the volcano cooling and degassing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also numerous [[hot spring]]s and [[fumerole]]s on the island,  due to an active [[hydrothermal]] system.  Favara Grande, in the south east of the island, is one of the best examples.  The island is also releasing a small amount of [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] through passive degassing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference

The island is the type locality for [[peralkaline]] [[rhyolite|rhyolitic]] rocks, [[pantellerite]]s.

The island is fertile, but lacks any fresh water. The principal town (pop. about 3,000) is on the north-west, upon the only harbour (only fit for small steamers), which is fortified. There was also a penal colony here.

== History ==

Archaeological evidence has unearthed dwellings and artifacts dated at 35,000&amp;nbsp;years ago.

The original population of Pantelleria did not come from Sicily, and was of [[Iberians|Iberian]] or Ibero-[[Ligures|Ligurian]] stock. After a considerable interval, during which the island probably remained uninhabited, the [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] took possession of it (no doubt owing to its importance as a station on the way to Sicily) probably about the beginning of the 7th century BC, occupying as their [[acropolis]] the twin hill of San Marco and Santa Teresa, {{convert|2|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} south of the town of Pantelleria.  The town possesses considerable remains of walls made of rectangular blocks of masonry, and also of a number of cisterns. [[Punic]] tombs have also been discovered, and the votive terra-cottas of a small sanctuary of the Punic period were found near the north coast.

The [[Roman Republic|Romans]] occupied the island as the [[Fasti Triumphales]] record in 255 BC, lost it again the next year, and recovered it in 217 BC. Under the [[Roman Empire|Empire]] it served as a place of banishment for prominent persons and members of the imperial family. The town enjoyed municipal rights.

In 700 the island was conquered by the [[Arabs]], from whose language the island's name is taken: ''Bent El Riah'' ??? ?????? &quot;the daughter of the winds&quot;, which represents the strong winds that arise off the north coast of Africa. In 1123 [[Roger of Sicily]] took the island, and in 1311 an [[Crown of Aragon|Aragonese]] fleet, under the command of [[Llu?s de Requesens]], won a considerable victory here, and his family became princes of Pantelleria until 1553, when the town was sacked by the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]].

Its capture was regarded as crucial to the Allied success in invading Sicily in 1943 because it allowed planes to be based in range of the larger island. Pantelleria was heavily bombarded, from both air and sea, in the days before the scheduled invasion, and the garrison finally surrendered as the landing troops were approaching. The capture of Pantelleria was called [[Operation Corkscrew]] and it played a part as a vital base for Allied aircraft during [[Operation Husky]].

[[Image:Pantelleria Sese grande o Sese del Re (1017196158).jpg|thumb|left|One of the &quot;Sesi&quot; on Pantelleria.]]

== Main sights ==

A Middle Bronze Age village was situated on the west coast, {{convert|3|km|abbr=on}} south-east of the harbour, with a rampart of small blocks of [[lava]], about {{convert|7.5|m|abbr=on}} high, {{convert|10|m|abbr=on}} wide at the base and {{convert|5|m|abbr=on}} at the top, upon the undefended eastern side: within it remains of huts were found, with pottery, tools of obsidian, and other artifacts. The objects discovered are in the museum at [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]].

To the south-east, in the district known as the Cunelie, are a large number of tombs, known as ''sesi'', similar in character to the [[nuraghe]] of [[Sardinia]], though of smaller size, consisting of round or elliptical towers with sepulchral chambers in them, built of rough blocks of [[lava]]. Fifty-seven of them can still be traced. The largest is an ellipse of about {{convert|18|by|20|m|abbr=on}}, but most of the sesi have a diameter of only {{convert|6|to|7|m|abbr=on}}. The identical character of the pottery found in the sesi with that found in the prehistoric village proves that the former are the tombs of the inhabitants of the latter.

== Wine ==

Pantelleria is noted for its sweet wines, Moscato di Pantelleria and Moscato Passito di Pantelleria, both made from the local [[Zibibbo]] grape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Transportation ==
The island is served by a single airport &lt;ref&gt; http://www.pantelleriairport.it/Home/default.aspx &lt;/ref&gt; served by AlItalia and Meridiana airlines. The island can be reached by ferries from [[Trapani]], and lies close to the main route from east to west through the Mediterranean.

'''Carthage National Museum''', along with the [[Bardo National Museum]] one of the two main archaeological museums in [[Tunisia]], is a [[national museum]] displaying archaeological items; it is sited at the hill of Byrsa in the heart of the city of [[Carthage]]. Founded in 1875, it is one of the country's most extensive museums.

Located near the Cathedral of Saint-Louis of Carthage, it allows the visitor to appreciate the magnitude of the city during the [[Punic]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] eras. Some of the best pieces found in excavations are limestone/marble carvings, depicting animals, plants and even human sculptures. Of special note is a marble [[sarcophagus]] of a priest and priestess from the 3rd century BC, discovered in the [[necropolis]] of Carthage. The Museum also has a noted collection of masks and jewelry in cast glass, Roman mosaics including the famous &quot;Lady of Carthage&quot;, a vast collection of Roman [[amphora]]s. It also contains numerous local items from the period of the [[Byzantine Empire]].  Also on display are objects of [[ivory]].

== History of the museum==

[[File:Cour MNC.JPG|thumb|left|Exterior]]
[[Image:Mus?e Lavigerie.jpg|thumb|right|Punic items]]
[[File:Salle Byrsa MNC 1.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Interior]]
The museum was founded in 1875 by Cardinal [[Charles Martial Lavigerie]] in the premises of the [[monastery]]; its name until 1956 was the '''Museum Lavigerie'''.

The museum is the product of excavations conducted by European archaeologists, in particular those made by [[Alfred Louis Delattre]]. The Annex was used at first to house the items found in searches in the necropolis of Carthage and excavations of the St. Louis hill but also Douim?s, the hill of Juno, the Sainte-Monique Hill and also the Carthaginian Christian [[basilicas]]. However, many object unearthed were sold to tourists when the museum had a number of examples of similar objects.&lt;ref&gt;Azedine Beschaouch,''The Legend of Carthage'', ed. Gallimard, Paris, 1993: 44&lt;/ref&gt;.

The museum received its present name in 1956 and opened for the first time as a national museum in 1963. It has undergone extensive restructuring in the 1990s, and has now been redesigned to accommodate new discoveries on the site of Carthage, especially the product of searches conducted as part of the international campaign of the [[UNESCO]], from 1972-1995.

== Punic collections==
=== Phoenician===
[[Image:C?ramiques MNC-edit.png|left|thumb|Punic ceramic discoveries, note the number of oil lamps unearthed.]]
The various excavations at the site have uncovered numerous items characterizing the Phoenician civilization. The museum contains items which reveal a distinct connection with the [[Levant]] steeped in Egyptian and in particular Greek culture, and the ties of Carthage with [[Sicily]] during the [[Hellenistic]] period.  Testimonies to these connections are many objects of [[pottery]], oil lamps and [[amulet]] s discovered in excavating the necropolis.

The museum has a fine collection of Punic ceramics found from the late 19th century. A number of lamps were found during the excavation of pottery kilns dating back to the [[Third Punic War]] &lt;ref&gt;Edward Lipinski [eds.],''Dictionary of the Phoenician and Punic civilization'', ed. Brepols, Paris, 1992 254&lt;/ref&gt;.

The [[amulet]]s of Egyptian gods ([[Isis]], [[Osiris]], [[Horus]], and [[Bes|B?s]]) indicates the importance of links between the Phoenicians and the [[Ancient Egypt]], the first retaining these cultural elements once they arrived in the Western Mediterranean.\
[[Image:Sarcophages carthage 1.jpg|right|thumb|The Sarcophages of the Priest and Priestess]]

=== Funeral objects===
Beautiful [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] dating to the end of the Punic era, have been found in the [[necropolis]], notably the sarcophagus of the priest and the priestess, which is on display in the museum. The priest has the right hand raised in a gesture of [[blessing]] &lt;ref&gt;Andr? Parrot, Maurice H. Ch?hab and Sabatino Moscati, ''Les Ph?niciens'', ?d. Gallimard, coll. L?univers des formes, Paris, 2007, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; The left hands of the two figures carry  vases containing [[incense]] for [[Liturgy|liturgical purposes]].&lt;ref&gt;H?di Slim et Nicolas Fauqu?, ''La Tunisie antique. De Hannibal ? saint Augustin'', ?d. Meng?s, Paris, 2001, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Image:Rasoirs puniques MN carthage.jpg|left|thumb|Ornate bronze Punic razors]]

Masks of glass also represent numerous deities, including objects which were intended to protect the deceased against the [[evil eye]]. There are also various items including [[razor]]s made of bronze and richly decorated with cast patterns, illustrating Egyptian and Greek influences  &lt;ref&gt;H?di Dridi, ''Carthage et le monde punique'', ?d. Les Belles Lettres, Paris, 2006, pp. 221-222&lt;/ref&gt;. A number of Punic amulets are also on display.
[[Image:Masque baal MN Carthage-retouche.png|right|thumb|upright|Br?le-parfum en forme de t?te de Ba?al]]

===Punic religion===
The terracotta perfume-burner in the form of the head of [[Ba'al Hammon]] was discovered in a sanctuary in the  Salammb? quarter unearthed by Dr [[Louis Carton]] shortly after World War I.; at the same time diverse other cultural objects came to light, including representations of [[Demeter]]&lt;ref&gt;H?di Slim and Nicolas Fauqu?, ''op. cit.'', p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

Les st?les du [[Tophet de Carthage|tophet]] constituent quant ? elles la collection la plus importante qui soit disponible. Bien que des st?les furent signal?es d?s les premi?res recherches sur le site de Carthage, en particulier lors des fouilles de Pricot de Sainte Marie (1874), dont la plupart coul?rent avec le ''[[Magenta (cuirass?)|Magenta]]'' en 1875, de nombreuses pi?ces parmi les plus int?ressantes sont d?pos?es au mus?e apr?s la d?couverte du sanctuaire en 1921. Outre les st?les plus communes en [[Gr?s (g?ologie)|gr?s]] d?[[El Haouaria]], les st?les de calcaire plus tardives font l?objet le plus souvent de d?cors vari?s : navires, palmiers, ?l?phants voire ?l?ments de portraits ? forte influence hell?nistique. Parfois, une inscription est pr?sente sur la st?le.
[[Image:St?le navire MN carthage.jpg|left|thumb|upright|St?le calcaire orn?e d?un navire et provenant du tophet]]
Des masques en forme de t?te de [[Ba'al Hammon]] sont ?galement expos?s, en particulier un grand masque d?couvert par le docteur Louis Carton au d?but du 20th century.

Le contenu de la ? chapelle Cintas ?, d?couverte au [[Tophet de Carthage|tophet]] par [[Pierre Cintas]] en 1947, fait l?objet d?une vitrine propre. Deux d?p?ts de foundation contenant surtout des c?ramiques y furent d?couverts, l?un situ? ? la base d?un mur et l?autre d?nomm?e ? cachette ? se trouvait sous le sol d?une petite pi?ce vo?t?e&lt;ref&gt;Fethi Chelbi, ? La chapelle Cintas ?, ''La M?diterran?e des Ph?niciens. De Tyr ? Carthage'', ?d. Somogy, Paris, 2007, p. 242&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Punic architecture ===

[[Image:Fragments colonnes MN Carthage.jpg|right|thumb|Punic pillars]]

There are some architectural elements of the Punic city on display, especially fragments of columns and pillars and structures.

Also outlined is a Phoenician inscription on black marble called &quot;registration ?dilitaire&quot;, found in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;M?hamed Hassine Fantar, ? Architecture punique en Tunisie ?, ''La Tunisie, carrefour du monde antique'', ?d. Faton, Paris, 1995, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Roman collections ==
=== Evidence of the 146 battle: The remains of the siege ===

[[Image:Vitrine 3e guerre punique.jpg|right|thumb|Artefacts from the siege of 149-146]]

The history of the Roman city of Carthage begins with a disaster, the will to destroy a rival dating from 146, which has some moving testimonies from the period on showcase. Common items on display are [[bullet]]s, [[sword]]s and stone [[catapult]]s. A skeleton of one of fighters who died violently, is also exposed.

=== Roman art===

[[Image:Bas-relief 2 MN Carthage.jpg|left|thumb|Bas-relief of a woman]]
[[Image:Statue imp?riale 2, MNC.jpg|right|thumb|Roman bust]]
Elements of the official Roman art were discovered on the Byrsa hill, including sculptures and [[relief|bas reliefs]] depicting victory. These excavated items have been interpreted as a commemoration of the victory over the [[Parthians]] in 166, during the reign of [[Marcus Aurelius]] and presented on a triumphal arch or monument portal.&lt;ref&gt;Colette Picard, ''Carthage'', ?d. Les Belles Lettres, Paris, 1951, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert-Charles Picard , ''L?art romain'', ?d. Presses universitaires de France, Paris, 1962, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;.

In addition, works from the reign of [[Augustus]] are presented including numerous busts. A remarkable representation of [[Auriga (slave)|Auriga]], holding a whip and a jug, a symbol of victory, is also exposed. This recent discovery is a valuable testimony to the attention of the Roman circus in the city, which was the second in size after the [[Circus Maximus]] in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Azedine Beschaouch, ''op. cit.'', pp. 107-108&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Mosaics ===
Although the collections of [[mosaic]]s of the museum are not comparable to those of [[Bardo National Museum]], the fact remains that genuine masterpieces are found in the museum. Among the recent discoveries, are from the panels found in a private spa located in Sidi Ghrib, near [[Tunis]]. It represents a topless woman running through a rose garden surrounded by water.&lt;ref&gt;H?di Slim et Nicolas Fauqu?, ''op. cit.'', p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;.On the same site a panel of marble and limestone was discovered showing the activity of a matron at the end of the bath. It shows the individual seated on the toilet, surrounded by two servants, one of which holds a mirror and the other carrying a basket with various jewels. At the ends of the mosaic, the artist presents the bath accessories: a pair of sandals, a basket of laundry, a jug, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Mohamed Yacoub, ''Splendeurs des mosa?ques de Tunisie'', ?d. Agence nationale du patrimoine, Tunis, 1995, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Christian and Byzantine Collections==
=== Testimonies of Ancient Christianity===

[[Image:Mosa?que chr?tienne MN Carthage.jpg|right|thumb|Mosa?que des quatre ?vang?listes d?couverte au ''vicus castrorum'']]

The mosaic of the four evangelists discovered in Carthage represents each of the four evangelists. In the center is a sphere in which integrates a [[crucifix|cross]]. This work symbolizes the triumph of [[Christianity]] and its distribution to the four cardinal points by [[Liliane Ennabli]] &lt;ref&gt;Liliane Ennabli, ''Carthage, une m?tropole chr?tienne, ?d. CNRS, Paris, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;.

Features of African Christianity at the time, such as ceramic tiles decorated with religious motifs were also excavated and are on display. Many of them are relatively large with decorative details which were intended to depict of the themes of the [[Old Testament]] including [[Daniel and the Lion's Den]].

A large number of funerary inscriptions discovered by [[Alfred Louis Delattre]] are displayed in the Carthage museum, found during his excavation of the main basilica.

===Byzantine Civilisation ===

[[Image:Dame Carthage(MNC).jpg|right|thumb|The famous ''Lady of Carthage'' mosaic]]
[[Image:Carreaux c?ramique chr?tienne mnc.JPG|thumb|left|Carreaux de c?ramique ? motifs chr?tiens]]

The famous &quot;Lady of Carthage&quot; mosaic dated back probably to the 6th century, is traditionally regarded as a portrait of a Byzantine emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Mohamed Yacoub, ''op. cit.'', p. 360&lt;/ref&gt; The technique of alternating mosaic tiles and glass tiles, the fineness of the design and elegance of the subject makea it a major piece of art mosaic from the Late Antiquity.

'''Himera''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{polytonic|?????}}), was an important [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] city of [[Sicily]], situated on the north coast of the island, at the mouth of the river of the same name (the modern [[Grande River (Sicily)|Grande]]), between Panormus (modern [[Palermo]]) and Cephaloedium (modern [[Cefal?]]). Its remains lie within the borders of the modern ''[[comune]]'' of [[Termini Imerese]].

==History==
===Foundation and earliest history===
It was the first Greek settlement on this part of the island and was a strategic outpost just outside the eastern boundary of the [[Carthaginian]]-controlled west. [[Thucydides]] says it was the only Greek city on this coast of Sicily,&lt;ref&gt;vi. 62, vii. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; which must however be understood with reference only to independent cities; [[Mylae]], which was also on the north coast, and certainly of Greek origin, being a dependency of [[Zancle]] (modern [[Messina]]). All authorities agree that Himera was a colony of Zancle, but Thucydides tells us that, with the emigrants from Zancle, who were of Chalcidic origin, were mingled a number of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracusan]] exiles, the consequence of which was, that, though the institutions ({{polytonic|??????}}) of the new city were Chalcidic, its dialect had a mixture of [[Doric Greek|Doric]].

The foundation of Himera is placed subsequent to that of Mylae (as, from their relative positions, might naturally have been expected) both by [[Strabo]] and [[Scymnus|Scymnus Chius]]: its date is not mentioned by Thucydides, but [[Diodorus]] tells us that it had existed 240 years at the time of its destruction by the Carthaginians, which would fix its first settlement in [[648 BCE]].&lt;ref&gt;Thuc. vi. 5; Strab. vi. p. 272; Scymn. Ch. 289; Diod. xiii. 62; Hecat. ''fr.'' 49; Scyl. p. 4. ? 13.&lt;/ref&gt; We have very little information as to its early history: an obscure notice in [[Aristotle]],&lt;ref&gt;Rhet. ii. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; from which it appears to have at one time fallen under the dominion of the tyrant [[Phalaris]], being the only mention we find of it, until about [[490 BCE]], when it afforded a temporary refuge to [[Scythes]], tyrant of Zancle, after his expulsion from the latter city.&lt;ref&gt;Herod. vi. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Not long after this event, Himera fell itself under the yoke of a despot named [[Terillus]], who sought to fortify his power by contracting a close alliance with [[Anaxilas]], at that time ruler both of Rhegium (modern [[Reggio di Calabria]]) and Zancle. But Terillus was unable to resist the power of [[Theron of Acragas|Theron]], despot of Agrigentum (modern [[Agrigento]]), and, being expelled by him from Himera, had recourse to the assistance of the Carthaginians, a circumstance which became the immediate occasion of the first great expedition of that people to Sicily, [[480 BCE]].&lt;ref&gt; ''Id.'' vii. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First interaction with Carthage===
The magnitude of the armament sent under [[Hamilcar]], who is said to have landed in Sicily with an army of 300,000 men, in itself sufficiently proves that the conquest of Himera was rather the pretext, than the object, of the war: but it is likely that the growing power of that city, in the immediate neighborhood of the Carthaginian settlements of Panormus and [[Solus]], had already given umbrage to the latter people. Hence it was against Himera that the first efforts of Hamilcar were directed: but Theron, who had thrown himself into the city with all the forces at his command, was able to maintain its defence till the arrival of [[Gelon of Syracuse]], who, notwithstanding the numerical inferiority of his forces, defeated the vast army of the Carthaginians with such slaughter that the [[Battle of Himera (480 BC)]] was regarded by the Greeks of Sicily as worthy of comparison with the contemporary victory of [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]].&lt;ref&gt;Herod. vii. 166, 167; Diod. xi. 20-23; Pind. ''Pyth.'' i. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; The same feeling probably gave rise to the tradition or belief, that both triumphs were achieved on the very same day.&lt;ref&gt;Herod. ''l. c.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===After the Battle of Himera===
This great victory left Theron in the undisputed possession of the sovereignty of Himera, as well as of that of Agrigentum; but he appears to have bestowed his principal attention upon the latter city, and consigned the government of Himera to his son [[Thrasydaeus]]. But the young man, by his violent and oppressive rule, soon alienated the minds of the citizens, who in consequence applied for relief to [[Hieron of Syracuse]], at that time on terms of hostility with Theron. The Syracusan despot, however, instead of lending assistance to the discontented party at Himera, betrayed their overtures to Theron, who took signal vengeance on the unfortunate Himeraeans, putting to death a large number of the disaffected citizens, and driving others into exile.&lt;ref&gt;Diod. xi. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, seeing that the city had suffered greatly from these severities, and that its population was much diminished, he sought to restore its prosperity by establishing there a new body of citizens, whom he collected from various quarters. The greater part of these new colonists were of [[Dorians|Dorian]] extraction; and though the two bodies of citizens were blended into one, and continued to live harmoniously together, we find that from this period Himera became a Doric city, and both adopted the institutions, and followed the policy, of the other Doric states of Sicily.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' xi. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; This settlement seems to have taken place in [[476 BCE]],&lt;ref&gt;There is a confusion about this date; for, though Diodorus relates the circumstances in the year of Phaedon, Ol. LXXVI. 1, which would place it in [[476 BCE]], he adds that the new colony subsisted 58 years, till its destruction by the Carthaginians, which would refer it to the year [[466 BCE]]. This last date is clearly incompatible with the fact that Theron died in [[472 BCE]].&lt;/ref&gt; and Himera continued subject to Theron till his death, in [[472 BCE]]: but Thrasydaeus retained possession of the sovereignty for a very short time after the death of his father, and his defeat by Hieron of Syracuse was speedily followed by his expulsion both from Agrigentum and Himera.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' xi. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[466 BCE]] we find the Himeraeans, in their turn, sending a force to assist the Syracusans in throwing off the yoke of [[Thrasybulus of Syracuse|Thrasybulus]]; and, in the general settlement of affairs which followed soon after, the exiles were allowed to return to Himera, where they appear to have settled quietly together with the new citizens. &lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' xi. 68, 76.&lt;/ref&gt; From this period Diodorus expressly tells us that Himera was fortunate enough to escape from civil dissensions,&lt;ref&gt;xi. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; and this good government must have secured to it no small share of the prosperity which was enjoyed by the Sicilian cities in general during the succeeding half-century.

But though we are told in general terms that the period which elapsed from this re-settlement of Himera till its destruction by the Carthaginians ([[461 BCE|461]]&amp;ndash;[[408 BCE]]), was one of peace and prosperity, the only notices we find of the city during this interval refer to the part it took at the time of the [[ancient Athens|Athenian]] expedition to Sicily, [[415 BCE]]. On that occasion, the Himeraeans were among the first to promise their support to Syracuse: hence, when [[Nicias]] presented himself before their port with the Athenian fleet, they altogether refused to receive him; and, shortly after, it was at Himera that [[Gylippus]] landed, and from whence he marched across the island to Syracuse, at the head of a force composed in great part of Himeraean citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thucydides]] vi. 62, vii. 1, 58; Diod. xiii. 4, 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Destruction by Carthage===
[[File:Him409.PNG|thumb|300px]]
A few years after this the prosperity of the city was brought to a sudden and abrupt termination by the [[Battle of Himera (409 BC)|great Carthaginian expedition to Sicily]]. Though the ostensible object of that armament, as it had been of the Athenian, was the support of the [[Segesta]]ns against their neighbors, the [[Selinunte|Selinuntines]], yet there can be no doubt that the Carthaginians, from the first, entertained more extensive designs; and, immediately after the destruction of Selinus, [[Hannibal Mago]], who commanded the expedition, hastened to turn his arms against Himera. That city was ill-prepared for defence; its fortifications were of little strength, but the citizens made a desperate resistance, and by a vigorous sally inflicted severe loss on the Carthaginians. They were at first supported by a force of about 4000 auxiliaries from Syracuse, under the command of [[Diocles of Syracuse|Diocles]]; but that general became seized with a panic fear for the safety of Syracuse itself, and precipitately abandoned Himera, leaving the unfortunate citizens to contend singlehanded against the Carthaginian power. The result could not be doubtful, and the city was soon taken by storm: a large part of the citizens were put to the sword, and not less than 3000 of them, who had been taken prisoners, were put to death in cold blood by Hannibal, as a sacrifice to the memory of his grandfather Hamilcar.&lt;ref&gt;Diod. xiii. 59-62; Xen. ''Hell.'' i. 1. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The city itself was utterly destroyed, its buildings razed to the ground, and even the temples themselves were not spared; the Carthaginian general being evidently desirous to obliterate all trace of a city whose name was associated with the great defeat of his countrymen.

[[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]], who relates the total destruction of Himera, tells us expressly that it was never rebuilt, and that the site remained uninhabited down to his own times.&lt;ref&gt;xi. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; It seems at first in contradiction with this statement, that he elsewhere includes the Himeraeans, as well as the Selinuntines and Agrigentines, among the exiled citizens that were allowed by the treaty, concluded with Carthage, in [[405 BCE]], to return to their homes, and inhabit their own cities, on condition of paying tribute to Carthage and not restoring their fortifications. &lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' xiii. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; And it seems clear that many of them at least availed themselves of this permission, as we find the Himeraeans subsequently mentioned among the states that declared in favour of [[Dionysius I of Syracuse]], at the commencement of his great war with Carthage in [[397 BCE]]; though they quickly returned to the Carthaginian alliance in the following year.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' xiv. 47, 56.&lt;/ref&gt; The explanation of this difficulty is furnished by [[Cicero]], who tells us that, after the destruction of Himera, those citizens who had survived the calamity of the war established themselves at [[Termini Imerese|Thermae]], within the confines of the same territory, and not far from their old town.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''''[[In Verrem]]'' ii. 3. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Diodorus gives a somewhat different account of the foundation of Thermae, which he represents as established by the Carthaginians themselves before the close of the war, in [[407 BCE]].&lt;ref&gt;Diod. xiii. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; But it is probable that both statements are substantially correct, and that the Carthaginians founded the new town in the immediate neighbourhood of Himera, in order to prevent the old site being again occupied; while the Himeraean exiles, when they returned thither, though they settled in the new town, naturally regarded themselves as still the same people, and would continue to bear the name of Himeraeans. How completely, even at a much later period, the one city was regarded as the representative of the other, appears from the statement of Cicero, that when [[Scipio Africanus]], after the capture of Carthage, restored to the Agrigentines and Gelenses the statues that had been carried off from their respective cities, he at the same time restored to the citizens of Thermae those that had been taken from Himera.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''In Verrem'' ii. 3. 5, iv. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence we cannot be surprised to find that, not only are the Himeraeans still spoken of as an existing people, but even that the name of Himera itself is sometimes inadvertently used as that of their city. Thus, in [[314 BCE]], Diodorus tells us that, by the treaty between [[Agathocles of Syracuse|Agathocles]] and the Carthaginians, it was stipulated that [[Heraclea Minoa|Heracleia]], [[Selinunte|Selinus]] and [[Himera]] should continue subject to Carthage as they had been before. &lt;ref&gt;Diod. xix. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; It is much more strange that we find the name of Himera reappear both in [[Mela]] and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], though we know from the distinct statements of Cicero and Strabo, as well as Diodorus, that it had ceased to exist centuries before.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo vi. p. 272; Mel. ii. 7. ? 16; Plin. iii. 8. s. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foundation of Thermae===
{{main|Termini Imerese}}
The new town of Thermae or Therma called for the sake of distinction Thermae Himerenses,&lt;ref&gt;{{polytonic|?????? ?? ???????}}, Pol.; {{polytonic|?????? ??????}}, Ptol.; {{polytonic|?????}}, {{polytonic|????? ???????}}, Diod.&lt;/ref&gt; which thus took the place of Himera, obviously derived its name from the hot springs for which it was celebrated, and the first discovery of which was connected by legends with the wanderings of [[Hercules]].&lt;ref&gt;Diod. iv. 23, v. 3; [[Pindar]] ''Ol.'' xii. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; It appears to have early become a considerable town, though it continued, with few and brief exceptions, to be subject to the Carthaginian rule. In the [[First Punic War]] its name is repeatedly mentioned. Thus, in [[260 BCE]], a body of [[ancient Rome|Roman]] troops were encamped in the neighborhood, when they were attacked by [[Hamilcar]], and defeated with heavy loss.&lt;ref&gt;Pol. i. 24; Diod. xxiii. 9. Exc. H. p. 503.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the close of the war, Thermae itself was besieged and taken by the Romans.&lt;ref&gt;Pol. i. 39; Diod. xxiii. 20. Exc. H. p. 506.&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero relates that the Roman government restored to the Thermitani their city and territory, with the free use of their own laws, as a reward for their steady fidelity. &lt;ref&gt;''quod semper in amicitia fideque mansissent'', Cicero ''[[In Verrem]]'' ii: 37.&lt;/ref&gt; They were on hostile terms with Rome during the First Punic War, so it can only be to the subsequent period that these expressions apply; but the occasion to which they refer is unknown. In the time of Cicero, Thermae appears to have been a flourishing place, carrying on a considerable amount of trade, though the orator speaks, of it as ''oppidum non maximum''.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' ii. 46, 75, iii. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; It seems to have received a [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]] in the time of [[Augustus]], whence we find mention in inscriptions of the ''Ordo et Populus splendidissimae Coloniae Augustae Himeraeorum Thermitanorum'': &lt;ref&gt;Castell. ''Inscr. Sicil.'' p. 47; Gruter. ''Inscr.'' p. 433, no. 6..&lt;/ref&gt; and there can be little doubt that the Thermae colonia of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] in reality refers to this town, though he evidently understood it to be Thermae Selinuntiae (modern [[Sciacca]]), as he places it on the south coast between Agrigentum and Selinus. &lt;ref&gt;Plin. iii. 8. s. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; There is little subsequent account of Thermae; but, as its name is found in [[Ptolemy]] and the Itineraries, it appears to have continued in existence throughout the period of the [[Roman Empire]], and probably never ceased to be inhabited, as the modern town of [[Termini Imerese]] retains the ancient site as well as name.&lt;ref&gt;Ptol. iii. 4. ? 4; ''[[Antonine Itinerary]]'' p. 92; ''[[Tabula Peutingeriana]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The magnificence of the ancient city, and the taste of its citizens for the encouragement of art, are attested by Cicero, who calls it ''in primis Siciliae clarum et ornatum''; and some evidence of it remained, even in the days of that orator, in the statues preserved by the Thermitani, to whom they had been restored by Scipio, after the conquest of Carthage; and which were valuable, not only as relics of the past, but from their high merit as works of art.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''In Verrem'' ii. 3. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The numerous examples of coins from Himera testify to the city's wealth in antiquity.

==Current situation==
Because of extensive remains, no doubt can therefore exist with regard to the site of Thermae, which would be, indeed, sufficiently marked by the hot springs themselves; but the exact position of the more ancient city of Himera was a subject of controversy until recent times. The opinion of [[Cluverius]], which has been followed by almost all subsequent writers into the 19th century, would place it on the left bank of the river which flows by Termini on the west, and is thence commonly known as the Fiume di Termini, though called in the upper part of its course Fiume San Leonardo. On this supposition the inhabitants merely removed from one bank of the river to the other; and this would readily explain the passages in which Himera and Thermae appear to be regarded as identical, and where the river Himera (which unquestionably gave name to the older city) is represented at the same time as flowing by Thermae.&lt;ref&gt;[[Silius Italicus]] xiv. 232; Plin. iii. 8. s. 14; Vib. ''Sequest.'' p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, there is great difficulty in supposing that the Fiume San Leonardo can be the river Himera; and all our data with regard to the latter would seem to support which the view of [[Fazello]], who identifies it with the [[Fiume Grande]], the mouth of which is distant just 8 miles from Termini. This is the view adopted by most modern scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Barrington|47 &amp; notes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This distance can hardly be said to be too great to be reconciled with Cicero's expression, that the new settlement was established ''non longe ab oppido antique'';&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''In Verrem'' ii. 3. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; while the addition that it was in the same territory &lt;ref&gt;''in ejusdem agri finibus'', ''l. c.''.&lt;/ref&gt; would seem to imply that it was not very near the old site. It may be added, that, in this case, the new site would have had the recommendation in the eyes of the Carthaginians of being nearer to their own settlements of Solus and Panormus, and, consequently, more within their command. But Fazello's view derives a strong confirmation from the circumstance, stated by him, that the site which he indicates, marked by the Torre di Bonfornello on the seacoast (on the left bank of the Fiume Grande, close to its mouth), though presenting no ruins, abounded in ancient relics, such as vases and bronzes; and numerous sepulchres had also been brought to light.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tommaso Fazello]] ix. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, neither Cluverius nor any other writer has noticed the existence of any ancient remains on the west bank of the Himera; nor does it appear that the site so fixed is one adapted for a city of importance.

==Archaeology==
The only recognizable ruin in this city is the Tempio della Vittoria (Temple of Victory), a [[Doric order|Doric]] structure supposedly built to commemorate the defeat of the Carthaginians (although recently some scholars have come to doubt this hypothesis).  To the south of the temple was the town's [[necropolis]].  Some artifacts recovered from this site are kept in a small [[antiquarium]].  However, the more impressive displays are in [[Palermo]]'s Museo Archeologico Regionale.

==Famous people==
Himera was celebrated in antiquity as the birth place of the poet [[Stesichorus]], who appears, from an anecdote preserved by [[Aristotle]], to have taken considerable part in the political affairs of his native city. His statue was still preserved at Thermae in the days of Cicero, and regarded with the utmost veneration.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle ''Rhet.'' ii. 20; Cicero ''In Verrem'' ii. 3. 5; [[Silius Italicus]] xiv. 232; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] iii. 19. ? 13.; ''[[Suda]]'', under {{polytonic|??????????}}.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ergoteles]], whose victory at the [[Olympic games]] is celebrated by [[Pindar]], was a citizen, but not a native, of Himera.&lt;ref&gt;Pind. ''Ol.'' xii.; Paus. vi. 4. ? 11.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Thermae had the honour of being the birthplace of the tyrant [[Agathocles]]. &lt;ref&gt;Diod. xix. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ancient Carthage''' (from  [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] ''{{lang|phn-Latn|Qart-?ad?at}}''&lt;ref&gt;''[http://books.google.ca/books?ei=hKY7Tb2bAdL2gAfPn7HCCA&amp;ct=result&amp;id=lrIiAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=carthage+%22hadsat%22&amp;q=+%22hadsat%22#search_anchor Annales]'', 1908. p.253.&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Semitic]] [[civilization]] centered on the [[Phoenicia]]n [[city-state]] of [[Carthage]], located in [[North Africa]] on the [[Gulf of Tunis]], outside what is now [[Tunis]], [[Tunisia]]. It was founded in 814 BC. Originally a dependency of the Phoenician state of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], Carthage gained independence around 650 BC and established a [[hegemony]] over other Phoenician settlements throughout the [[Mediterranean]], [[North Africa]] and what is now [[Spain]] which lasted until 146 BC. At the height of the city's prominence, its influence extended over most of the western [[Mediterranean]].

Carthage was in a constant state of struggle with the [[Roman Republic]], which led to a series of conflicts known as the [[Punic Wars]]. They also had to deal with the volatile [[Berber people|Berbers]], the indigenous inhabitants of the entire area where Carthage was built. After the [[Third Punic War|third and final Punic War]], Carthage was destroyed and then occupied by Roman forces. Nearly all of the other Phoenician city-states and former Carthaginian dependencies fell into Roman hands from then on.

==Extent of Phoenician settlement==
In order to provide safe harbors for their merchant fleets, or to maintain a Phoenician monopoly on an area's natural resources, or to conduct trade free of outside interference, the Phoenicians established numerous colonial cities along the coasts of the Mediterranean. They were also stimulated to found these cities by a need for revitalizing trade in order to pay [[tribute]] to the succession of empires that ruled [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], [[Sidon]], and [[Byblos]], and by fear of complete [[Greek colonization]] of that part of the Mediterranean suitable for commerce. The Phoenicians lacked the population or necessity to establish large self-sustaining cities abroad, and most of their colonial cities had fewer than 1,000 inhabitants, but Carthage and a few others developed larger populations.

==Carthaginian Control==
Some 300 colonies were established in Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria, [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], and to a much lesser extent, on the arid coast of Libya. The Phoenicians controlled [[Cyprus]], [[Sardinia]], [[Corsica]], and the [[Balearic Islands]], as well as minor possessions in [[Crete]] and [[Sicily]]; the latter settlements were in perpetual conflict with the Greeks. The Phoenicians managed to control all of Sicily for a limited time. The entire area later came under the leadership and protection of Carthage, which in turn dispatched its own colonists to found new cities or to reinforce those that declined with [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]] and [[Sidon]].

The first colonies were made on the two paths to Iberia's mineral wealth ? along the North African coast and on [[Sicily]], [[Sardinia]] and the [[Balearic Islands]]. The centre of the Phoenician world was [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], serving as an economic and political hub. The power of this city waned following numerous sieges and its eventual destruction by [[Alexander the Great]], and the role as leader passed to [[Sidon]], and eventually to Carthage. Each colony paid tribute to either Tyre or Sidon, but neither had actual control of the colonies. This changed with the rise of Carthage, since the Carthaginians appointed their own magistrates to rule the towns and Carthage retained much direct control over the colonies. This policy resulted in a number of Iberian towns siding with the Romans during the [[Punic Wars]].

==Treaty with Rome==
In 509 BC, a treaty was signed between Carthage and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] indicating a division of influence and commercial activities. This is the first known source indicating that Carthage had gained control over [[Sicily]] and [[Sardinia]].

==5th Century==
By the beginning of the 5th century BC, Carthage had become the commercial center of the West Mediterranean region, a position it retained until overthrown by the [[Roman Republic]]. The city had conquered most of the old Phoenician colonies e.g. [[Hadrumetum]], [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]], and [[Kerkouane]], subjugated the [[Ancient Libya|Libyan]] tribes (with the [[Numidian]] and Mauretanian kingdoms remaining more or less independent), and taken control of the entire North African coast from modern [[Morocco]] to the borders of [[Egypt]] (not including the [[Cyrenaica]], which was eventually incorporated into [[Hellenistic Egypt]]). Its influence had also extended into the Mediterranean, taking control over [[Sardinia]], [[Malta]], the [[Balearic Islands]], and the western half of [[Sicily]], where coastal fortresses such as [[Motya]] or [[Lilybaeum]] secured its possessions. Important colonies had also been established on the [[Iberian peninsula]]. Their cultural influence in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] is documented, but the degree of their political influence before the conquest by [[Hamilcar Barca]] is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Barcelo, Pedro.

== The Sicilian Wars ==
{{further2|the [[Sicilian Wars]]}}

===First Sicilian war===
Carthage's economic successes, and its dependence on shipping to conduct most of its trade, led to the creation of a powerful Carthaginian navy. This, coupled with its success and growing hegemony, brought Carthage into increasing conflict with the [[Greeks]] of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], the other major power contending for control of the central Mediterranean.

The island of Sicily, lying at Carthage's doorstep, became the arena on which this conflict played out. From their earliest days, both the Greeks and Phoenicians had been attracted to the large island, establishing a large number of colonies and trading posts along its coast; battles had been fought between these settlements for centuries.

By 480 BC, [[Gelo]], the [[tyrant]] leader of Greek [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], backed in part by support from other Greek [[city-states]], was attempting to unite the island under his rule. This imminent threat could not be ignored, and Carthage ? possibly as part of an alliance with [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]], then engaged military force, under the leadership of the general [[Hamilcar]]. Traditional accounts give Hamilcar's army a strength of three hundred thousand men; though these are almost certainly exaggerated, it must nonetheless have been of formidable force.

En route to Sicily, however, Hamilcar suffered losses (possibly severe) due to poor weather. Landing at Panormus (modern-day [[Palermo]]), Hamilcar spent 3&amp;nbsp;days reorganizing his forces and repairing his battered fleet. The Carthaginians marched along the coast to Himera, and made camp before engaging in the [[Battle of Himera (480 BC)|Battle of Himera]]. Hamilcar was either killed during the battle or committed suicide in shame. As a result the nobility negotiated peace and replaced the old monarchy with a republic.

===Second Sicilian War===
By 410 BC, Carthage had recovered after serious defeats. It had conquered much of modern day [[Tunisia]], strengthened and founded new colonies in [[Maghreb|North Africa]], [[Hanno the Navigator]] had made  his journey down the African coast, and [[Himilco the Navigator]] had explored the European Atlantic coast. Although, in that year, the Iberian colonies seceded ? cutting off Carthage's major supply of [[silver]] and [[copper]] ? [[Hannibal Mago]], the grandson of Hamilcar, began preparations to reclaim Sicily, while expeditions were also led into [[Morocco]] and [[Senegal]], and also into the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]].

In 409 BC, Hannibal Mago set out for Sicily with his force. He was successful in capturing the smaller cities of Selinus (modern [[Selinunte]]) and [[Himera]], before returning triumphantly to Carthage with the spoils of war. But the primary enemy, Syracuse, remained untouched and, in [[405 BC]], Hannibal Mago led a second Carthaginian expedition to claim the entire island. This time, however, he met with fierce resistance and ill-fortune. During the [[siege]] of [[Agrigentum]], the Carthaginian forces were ravaged by plague, Hannibal Mago himself succumbing to it. Although his successor, [[Himilco]], successfully extended the campaign by breaking a Greek siege, capturing the city of [[Gela]] and repeatedly defeating the army of [[Dionysius I of Syracuse|Dionysius]], the new tyrant of Syracuse, he, too, was weakened by the plague and forced to [[sue for peace]] before returning to Carthage.

In 398 BC, Dionysius had regained his strength and broke the peace treaty, striking at the Carthaginian stronghold of [[Motya]]. Himilco responded decisively, leading an expedition which not only reclaimed Motya, but also captured [[Messina, Italy|Messina]]. Finally, he laid siege to Syracuse itself. The siege was close to a success throughout 397 BC, but in 396 BC plague again ravaged the Carthaginian forces, and they collapsed.

Sicily by this time had become an obsession for Carthage. Over the next sixty years, Carthaginian and Greek forces engaged in a constant series of skirmishes. By 340 BC, Carthage had been pushed entirely into the southwest corner of the island, and an uneasy peace reigned over the island.

===Third Sicilian War===
[[Image:NE 323bc.jpg|thumb|left|Mediterranean sea nations in 323 BC.]]
In 315 BC, [[Agathocles]], the tyrant (administrating governor) of Syracuse, seized the city of [[Messene]] (present-day Messina). In [[311 BC]] he invaded the last Carthaginian holdings on Sicily, breaking the terms of the current peace treaty, and laid siege to [[Agrigentum|Akragas]].

[[Hamilcar]], grandson of [[Hanno the Navigator]], led the Carthaginian response and met with tremendous success. By [[310 BC]], he controlled almost all of Sicily and had laid siege to Syracuse itself. In desperation, Agathocles secretly led an expedition of 14,000 men to the mainland, hoping to save his rule by leading a counterstrike against Carthage itself. In this, he was successful: Carthage was forced to recall Hamilcar and most of his army from Sicily to face the new and unexpected threat. Although Agathocles' army was eventually defeated in 307 BC, Agathocles himself escaped back to Sicily and was able to negotiate a peace which maintained Syracuse as a stronghold of Greek power in Sicily.

==Pyrrhic War==
{{main|Pyrrhic War}}
[[File:Romtrireme.jpg|thumb|right||[[Trireme]] mosaic from Carthage, [[Bardo Museum]], Tunis.]]
Between 280 and 275 BC, [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]] waged two major campaigns in the western Mediterranean: one against the emerging power of the [[Roman Republic]] in southern Italy, the other against Carthage in Sicily.

Pyrrhus sent an advance guard to Tarentium under the command of Cineaus with 3,000 [[infantry]]. Pyrrhus marched the main army across the Greek peninsula and engaged in battles with the Thessalians and the Athenian army. After his early success on the march Pyrrhus entered Tarentium to rejoin with his advance guard.

In the midst of Pyrrhus's Italian campaigns, he received envoys from the Sicilian cities of [[Agrigentum]], [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], and [[Leontini]], asking for military aid to remove the Carthaginian dominance over that island.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Pyrrhus'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pyrrhus*.html#22 22:1?22:3]&lt;/ref&gt; Pyrrhus agreed, and fortified the Sicilian cities with an army of 20,000 [[infantry]] and 3,000 [[cavalry]] and 20 War Elephants, supported by some 200 ships. Initially, Pyrrhus'  Sicilian campaign against Carthage was a success, pushing back the Carthaginian forces, and capturing the city-fortress of [[Erice|Eryx]], even though he was not able to capture [[Lilybaeum]].&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Pyrrhus '', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pyrrhus*.html#22 22:4?22:6]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following these losses, Carthage sued for peace, but Pyrrhus refused unless Carthage was willing to renounce its claims on Sicily entirely. According to [[Plutarch]], Pyrrhus set his sights on conquering Carthage itself, and to this end, began outfitting an expedition. However, his ruthless treatment of the Sicilian cities in his preparations for this expedition, and his execution of two Sicilian rulers whom he claimed were plotting against him led to such a rise in animosity towards the Greeks, that Pyrrhus withdrew from Sicily and returned to deal with events occurring in southern Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Pyrrhus '', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pyrrhus*.html#23 Chapter 23]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pyrrhus's campaigns in Italy were inconclusive, and Pyrrhus eventually withdrew to Epirus. For Carthage, this meant a return to the status quo. For Rome, however, the failure of Pyrrhus to defend the colonies of ''[[Magna Graecia]]'' meant that Rome absorbed them into its &quot;[[sphere of influence]]&quot;, bringing it closer to complete domination of the Italian peninsula. Rome's domination of Italy, and proof that Rome could pit its military strength successfully against major international powers, would pave the way to the future Rome-Carthage conflicts of the [[Punic Wars]].

==The Punic Wars==

When Agathocles died in 288 BC, a large company of Italian mercenaries who had previously been held in his service found themselves suddenly without employment. Rather than leave Sicily, they seized the city of Messana. Naming themselves [[Mamertines]] (or &quot;sons of Mars&quot;), they became a law unto themselves, terrorizing the surrounding countryside.

The Mamertines became a growing threat to Carthage and Syracuse alike. In 265 BC, [[Hiero II of Syracuse|Hiero II]], former general of Pyrrhus and the new tyrant of Syracuse, took action against them. Faced with a vastly superior force, the Mamertines divided into two factions, one advocating surrender to Carthage, the other preferring to seek aid from Rome. While the [[Roman Senate]] debated the best course of action, the Carthaginians eagerly agreed to send a garrison to Messana. A Carthaginian garrison was admitted to the city, and a Carthaginian fleet sailed into the Messanan harbor. However, soon afterwards they began negotiating with Hiero; alarmed, the Mamertines sent another embassy to Rome asking them to expel the Carthaginians.

Hiero's intervention had placed Carthage's military forces directly across the narrow channel of water that separated Sicily from Italy. Moreover, the presence of the Carthaginian fleet gave them effective control over this channel, the [[Strait of Messina]], and demonstrated a clear and present danger to nearby Rome and her interests.

As a result, the Roman Assembly, although reluctant to ally with a band of mercenaries, sent an expeditionary force to return control of Messana to the Mamertines.

The Roman attack on the Carthaginian forces at Messana triggered the first of the [[Punic Wars]]. Over the course of the next century, these three major conflicts between Rome and Carthage would determine the course of Western civilization. The wars included a Carthaginian invasion led by [[Hannibal Barca|Hannibal]], which nearly prevented the rise of the [[Roman Empire]].

In 266/265 BC the Romans, under the command of [[Regulus]], landed in Africa and after suffering some initial defeats the Carthaginian forces eventually repelled the Roman invasion.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyos, Dexter. ''Truceless War: Carthage's Fight for Survival, 241 to 237 BC''. [[Brill Publishers]] 2007, ISBN 9004160760, p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the First Punic War, Carthage faced a major [[Mercenary War|mercenary revolt]] which changed the internal political landscape of Carthage (bringing the [[Barcid]] family to prominence), and affected Carthage's international standing, as Rome used the events of the war to base a claim by which it seized [[Sardinia]] and [[Corsica]].

The [[Second Punic War]] lasted from [[218 BC|218]] to [[202 BC]] and involved combatants in the western and eastern [[Mediterranean]], with the participation of the [[Berber people|Berbers]] on Carthage's side. The war is marked by [[Hannibal]]'s surprising overland journey and his costly crossing of the Alps, followed by his reinforcement by Gaulish allies and crushing victories over Roman armies in the [[battle of the Trebia]] and the giant ambush at [[battle of Lake Trasimene|Trasimene]]. Against his skill on the battlefield the Romans deployed the [[Fabian strategy]]. But because of the increasing unpopularity of this approach, the Romans resorted to a further major field battle. The result was the Roman defeat at [[battle of Cannae|Cannae]].

In consequence many Roman allies went over to Carthage, prolonging the war in Italy for over a decade, during which more Roman armies were destroyed on the battlefield. Despite these setbacks, the Roman forces were more capable in siegecraft than the Carthaginians and recaptured all the major cities that had joined the enemy, as well as defeating a Carthaginian attempt to reinforce Hannibal at the [[battle of the Metaurus]]. In the meantime in Iberia, which served as the main source of manpower for the Carthaginian army, a second Roman expedition under [[Scipio Africanus|Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus Major]] took [[Cartagena, Spain|New Carthage]] by assault and ended Carthaginian rule over Iberia in the [[battle of Ilipa]]. The final showdown was the [[battle of Zama]] in Africa between Scipio Africanus and Hannibal, resulting in the latter's defeat and the imposition of harsh peace conditions on Carthage, which ceased to be a major power and became a Roman client-state.

The [[Third Punic War]] ([[149 BC]] to [[146 BC]]) was the third and last of the Punic Wars. The war was a much smaller engagement than the two previous Punic Wars and primarily consisted of a single main action, the [[Battle of Carthage (c.149 BC)|Battle of Carthage]], but resulted in the complete destruction of the city of Carthage, the annexation of all remaining Carthaginian territory by Rome, and the death or enslavement of the entire Carthaginian population. The Third Punic War ended Carthage's independent existence.

==Culture==
===Language===
Carthaginians spoke [[Punic language|Punic]], a variety of [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] which was a [[Semitic]] language originating in the Carthaginians' original homeland of [[Phoenicia]] (modern Lebanon).

===Economy===
{{Refimprove|date=December 2007}}
[[File:Port circulaire laurier rose.jpg|thumb|left|Carthaginian port]]
Carthaginian commerce was by sea throughout the Mediterranean and far into the Atlantic and by land across the Sahara desert. According to Aristotle, the Carthaginians and others had treaties of commerce to regulate their exports and imports.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, Politics Book 3,IX&lt;/ref&gt;

The empire of Carthage depended heavily on its trade with [[Tartessos]] and other cities of the Iberian peninsula, from which it obtained vast quantities of [[silver]], [[lead]], and, even more importantly, [[tin]] ore, which was essential for the manufacture of [[bronze]] objects by the civilizations of antiquity. Its trade relations with the Iberians and the naval might that enforced Carthage's monopoly on trade with tin-rich Britain and the Canary Islands allowed it to be the sole significant broker of tin and maker of bronze. Maintaining this monopoly was one of the major sources of power and prosperity for Carthage, and a Carthaginian merchant would rather crash his ship upon the rocky shores of Britain than reveal to any rival how it could be safely approached. In addition to being the sole significant distributor of tin, its central location in the Mediterranean and control of the waters between Sicily and Tunisia allowed it to control the eastern nations' supply of tin. Carthage was also the Mediterranean's largest producer of silver, mined in Iberia and the North African coast, and, after the tin monopoly, this was one of its most profitable trades. One mine in Iberia provided Hannibal with 300 Roman pounds (3.75 [[Talent (unit)|talent]]s) of silver a day.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Nat His'' 33,96&lt;/ref&gt;

Carthage's economy began as an extension of that of its parent city, [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]]. Its massive merchant fleet traversed the trade routes mapped out by Tyre, and Carthage inherited from Tyre the art of making the extremely valuable dye [[Tyrian Purple]]. It was one of the most highly valued commodities in the ancient Mediterranean, being worth fifteen to twenty times its weight in gold. High Roman officials could only afford togas with a small stripe of it. Carthage also produced a less-valuable crimson pigment from the [[Kermes (genus)|kermes]], a [[scale insect]] local to the area.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Carthage produced finely embroidered and dyed [[textiles]] of [[cotton]], [[linen]], [[wool]], and [[silk]], artistic and functional [[pottery]], [[faience]], [[incense]], and perfumes. Its artisans worked with glass, wood, [[alabaster]], ivory, bronze, brass, lead, gold, silver, and precious stones to create a wide array of goods, including mirrors, highly admired furniture and cabinetry, beds, bedding, and pillows, jewelry, arms, implements, and household items. It traded in salted Atlantic fish and fish sauce, and brokered the manufactured, agricultural, and natural products of almost every Mediterranean people.

[[File:Head man Carthage Louvre AO3783.jpg|thumb|Punic pendant in the form of a bearded head, 4th?3rd century BC.]]
In addition to manufacturing, Carthage practised highly advanced and productive agriculture, using iron ploughs, irrigation, and crop rotation. [[Mago (agricultural writer)|Mago]] wrote a famous treatise on agriculture which the Romans ordered translated after Carthage was captured. After the Second Punic War, [[Hannibal Barca|Hannibal]] promoted agriculture to help restore Carthage's economy and pay the war indemnity to Rome (10,000 talents or 800,000 Roman pounds of silver&lt;ref&gt;Pliny 33,51&lt;/ref&gt;), and he was largely successful.

Carthage produced wine, which was highly prized in Rome, [[Etruria]] (the [[Etruscans]]), and Greece. Rome was a major consumer of raisin wine, a Carthaginian specialty. Fruits, nuts, grain, grapes, dates, and olives were grown, and olive oil was exported in competition with Greece. Carthage also raised fine horses, similar to today's [[Arabian horse]]s, which were greatly prized and exported.

Carthage's merchant ships, which surpassed even those of the cities of the [[Levant]], visited every major port of the Mediterranean, Britain, the coast of Africa, and the [[Canary Islands]]. These ships were able to carry over 100 tons of goods. The commercial fleet of Carthage was comparable in size and tonnage to the fleets of major European powers in the 18th century.

Merchants at first favored the ports of the east: Egypt, the Levant, Greece, Cyprus, and Asia Minor. But after Carthage's control of Sicily brought it into conflict with Greek colonists, it established commercial relations in the western Mediterranean, including trade with the [[Etruscans]].

Carthage also sent caravans into the interior of Africa and [[Persia]]. It traded its manufactured and agricultural goods to the coastal and interior peoples of Africa for salt, gold, timber, ivory, ebony, apes, peacocks, skins, and hides. Its merchants invented the practice of sale by auction and used it to trade with the African tribes. In other ports, they tried to establish permanent warehouses or sell their goods in open-air markets. They obtained amber from Scandinavia and tin from the Canary Islands. From the Celtiberians, Gauls, and Celts, they obtained amber, tin, silver, and furs. Sardinia and Corsica produced gold and silver for Carthage, and Phoenician settlements on islands such as [[Malta]] and the [[Balearic Islands]] produced commodities that would be sent back to Carthage for large-scale distribution. Carthage supplied poorer civilizations with simple things, such as pottery, metallic products, and ornamentations, often displacing the local manufacturing, but brought its best works to wealthier ones such as the Greeks and Etruscans. Carthage traded in almost every commodity wanted by the ancient world, including spices from Arabia, Africa and India, and slaves (the empire of Carthage temporarily held a portion of Europe and sent conquered white warriors into Northern African slavery).{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

These trade ships went all the way down the Atlantic coast of Africa to [[Senegal]] and Nigeria. One account has a Carthaginian trading vessel exploring Nigeria, including identification of distinguishing geographic features such as a coastal volcano and an encounter with gorillas (See [[Hanno the Navigator]]). Irregular trade exchanges occurred as far west as Madeira and the [[Canary Islands]], and as far south as southern Africa. Carthage also traded with [[History of India|India]] by traveling through the [[Red Sea]] and the perhaps-mythical lands of [[Ophir]] (India/Arabia?) and [[Land of Punt|Punt]], which may be present-day [[Somalia]].

Archaeological finds show evidence of all kinds of exchanges, from the vast quantities of tin needed for a bronze-based metals civilization to all manner of textiles, ceramics and fine metalwork. Before and in between the wars, Carthaginian merchants were in every port in the Mediterranean, buying and selling, establishing warehouses where they could, or just bargaining in open-air markets after getting off their ships.

The Etruscan language has not yet been deciphered, but archaeological excavations of Etruscan cities show that the Etruscan civilization was for several centuries a customer and a vendor to Carthage, long before the rise of Rome. The Etruscan city-states were, at times, both commercial partners of Carthage and military allies.

===Government===
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2007}}
[[File:Quartier Punique.JPG|thumb|left|Punic district of Carthage]]
The government of  Carthage changed dramatically after the total rout of the Carthaginian forces at the battle of Himera on Sicily in 483 B.C.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miles&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|115-116}} The [[List of monarchs of Carthage|Magonid clan]] was compelled to compromise and allow representative and even some democratic institutions.  Carthage remained to a great extent an [[oligarchy|oligarchal]] [[republic]], which relied on a system of [[checks and balances]] and ensured a form of public accountability. At the head of the Carthaginian state were now two annually elected, not hereditary, [[Shofet|Suffets]] &lt;ref name=&quot;Miles&quot;/&gt;{{rp|130}}(thus rendered in Latin by [[Livy]] 30.7.5, attested in Punic inscriptions as SP?M {{IPA|/?uft?im/}}, meaning &quot;judges&quot; and obviously related to the [[Bible|Biblical]] [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ruler title {{lang|he-Latn|''Shophet''}}  &quot;[[Biblical Judges|Judge]]&quot;), similar to modern day executive [[president]]s. Greek and Roman authors more commonly referred to them as &quot;kings&quot;. SP? {{IPA|/?ufit?/}} might originally have been the title of the city's governor, installed by the mother city of Tyre. A [[List of monarchs of Carthage|list of the hereditary suffetes/&quot;kings&quot; can be found here.]]

In the historically attested period, the two Suffets were elected annually from among the most wealthy and influential families and ruled collegially, similarly to [[Roman consul]]s (and equated with these by Livy). This practice might have descended from the [[plutocracy|plutocratic]] oligarchies that limited the Suffet's power in the first Phoenician cities.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}.&lt;ref name=Miles/&gt;  A range of more junior officials and special commissioners oversaw different aspects of governmental business such as public works, tax-collecting, and the administration of the state treasury.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miles&quot;/&gt;{{rp|130}} &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aristocratic families were represented in a supreme council (Roman sources speak of a Carthaginian &quot;[[Senate]]&quot;, and Greek ones of a &quot;council of [[Elder (administrative title)|Elders]]&quot; or a [[gerousia]]), which had a wide range of powers; however, it is not known whether the Suffets were elected by this council or by an assembly of the people. Suffets appear to have exercised judicial and executive power, but not military, as generals were chosen by the administration.  The final supervision of the Treasury and Foreign Affairs seems to have come under the Council of Elders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miles&quot;/&gt;{{rp|130}}.

There was a body known as the Tribunal of the [[Hundred and Four]], which Aristotle compared to the Spartan [[ephors]].&lt;ref&gt;Aristiotle, Politics, Book 2, part 11&lt;/ref&gt; These were judges who acted as a kind of higher constitutional court and oversaw the actions of generals {{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}, who could sometimes be sentenced to [[crucifixion]], as well as other officials.  Panels of special commissioners, called pentarchies, war appointed from the Tribunal of One Hundred and Four:  they appear to have deal with a variety of affairs of state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miles&quot;/&gt;{{rp|130}}.

Although the city's administration was firmly controlled by oligarchs {{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}, democratic elements were to be found as well: Carthage had elected legislators, trade unions and town meetings in the form of a Popular Assembly.  [[Aristotle]] reported in his [[Politics (Aristotle)|''Politics'']] that unless the Suffets and the Council reached a unanimous decision, the Carthaginian popular assembly had the decisive vote - unlike the situation in Greek states with similar constitutions such as [[Sparta]] and [[Crete]].  [[Polybius]], in his History book 6, also stated that at the time of the Punic Wars, the Carthaginian public held more sway over the government than the people of Rome held over theirs (a development he regarded as evidence of decline).  This may have been due to the influence of the [[Barcid]] faction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miles&quot;/&gt;

[[Eratosthenes]], head of the [[Library of Alexandria]], noted that the Greeks had been wrong to describe all non-Greeks as barbarians, since the Carthaginians as well as the Romans had a constitution. [[Aristotle]] also knew and discussed the Carthaginian constitution in his ''Politics'' (Book II, Chapter 11). During the period between the end of the First Punic War and the end of the Second Punic War, members of the [[Barcid]] family dominated in Carthaginian politics. They were given control of the Carthaginian military and all the Carthaginian territories outside of Africa.

==Religion==
{{Main|Religion in Carthage}}
Carthaginian religion was based on Phoenician religion (derived from the faiths of the [[Levant]]), a form of [[polytheism]]. Many of the gods the Carthaginians worshiped were localized and are now known only under their local names. It also had [[Jewish]] communities (which still exist; see [[Tunisian Jews]] and [[Algerian Jews]]).

===Pantheon===
[[File:Carthage EL shekel 2250013.jpg|thumb|Carthaginian coins from circa 310-290 BC showing the wreathed head of [[Tanit]]]]
The supreme divine couple was that of [[Tanit]] and [[Ba%27al_Hammon#Ba.27al_of_Carthage|Ba'al Hammon]]. The goddess [[Astarte]] seems to have been popular in early times. At the height of its cosmopolitan era, Carthage seems to have hosted a large array of divinities from the neighbouring civilizations of Greece, Egypt and the Etruscan city-states. A pantheon was presided over by the father of the gods, but a goddess was the principal figure in the Phoenician pantheon.

===Caste of priests and acolytes===
Surviving Punic texts are detailed enough to give a portrait of a very well organized caste of temple priests and acolytes performing different types of functions, for a variety of prices. Priests were clean shaven, unlike most of the population. In the first centuries of the city ritual celebrations included rhythmic dancing, derived from Phoenician traditions.

===Punic stelae===
[[File:Karthago Tophet 2.JPG|thumb|Stelae on the Tophet]]
[[Cippi]] and [[stelae]] of limestone are characteristic monuments of Punic art and religion, and are found throughout the western Phoenician world in unbroken continuity, both historically and geographically. Most of them were set up over urns containing cremated human remains, placed within open-air sanctuaries. Such sanctuaries constitute striking relics of Punic civilization.

===Child sacrifice question===
&lt;!--
Before making any edits regarding the alleged practice of child sacrifice, please read the archived discussion at [[Talk:Carthage/Human Sacrifice]]. We have been around this block several times before.

Please refrain from entering text that comes down conclusively on the question of whether or not child sacrifice was, in fact, practiced in Carthage. This question has been the subject of long and heated debate among editors of this article and has occasioned edit warring, semi-protection, etc.

The current consensus is that nobody knows for sure and that we should simply report both sides of the question without asserting which one is right. Any departure from this stance is likely to get edited out fairly quickly.

Parts of this section may be canted towards the assertion that child sacrifice ''was'' practiced in Carthage. It is reasonable to put in qualifying text that asserts that the details of the child sacrifice are based on accounts which may not be altogether reliable.

We are in the process of looking for sources for these details so that the descriptions can be based on [[WP:RS|reliable sources]].

See [[Talk:Carthage/Human Sacrifice]] for details of past debate on this topic.

--&gt;

Carthage under the Phoenicians was criticized by its neighbors for [[child sacrifice]]. [[Plutarch]] (''c.'' 46?120) mentions the practice, as do [[Tertullian]], [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]], [[Philo]] and [[Diodorus Siculus]].&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus. Trans. C.H. Oldfather. ''Diodorus of Sicily 1, VI, VIII, IX''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1954-1963 (The Loeb Classical Library).&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Herodotos]] and [[Polybius]] do not. Skeptics contend that if Carthage's critics were aware of such a practice, however limited, they would have been horrified by it and exaggerated its extent due to their polemical treatment of the Carthaginians.&lt;ref&gt;Carthage a History, S Lancel, trans A Nevill, p252&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hebrew Bible]] also mentions child sacrifice practiced by the [[Canaan]]ites, ancestors of the Carthaginians. The Greek and Roman critics, according to Charles Picard, objected not to the killing of children but to the religious nature of it. As in both ancient Greece and Rome, inconvenient children were not uncommonly killed by exposure to the elements. However, the Greeks and Romans engaged in the practice for economic rather than religious reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Life in Carthage Gilbert and Colette Charels-Picard pp149-50&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern [[archaeology]] in formerly Punic areas has discovered a number of large cemeteries for children and infants. These cemeteries may have been used as graves for [[Stillbirth|stillborn]] infants or children who died very early.&lt;ref&gt;Carhtage a History, S Lancel, trans A Nevill, pp251&lt;/ref&gt; Modern archeological excavations have been interpreted as confirming Plutarch's reports of Carthaginian child sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ualberta.ca/~kmacfarl/CLASS_110/5.HittitesPhoeneciansIsraelites.html Kelly A. MacFarlane, University of Alberta, ''Hittites and Phoenician'']&lt;/ref&gt; In a single child cemetery called the [[Tophet]] by archaeologists, an estimated 20,000 urns were deposited between 400 BC and 200 BC, with the practice continuing until the early years of the Christian period. The urns contained the charred bones of newborns and in some cases the bones of fetuses and 2-year-olds. These remains have been interpreted to mean that in the cases of stillborn babies, the parents would sacrifice their youngest child. There is a clear correlation between the frequency of cremation and the well-being of the city. In bad times (war, poor harvests) cremations became more frequent, but it is not possible to know why. The correlation could be because bad times inspired the Carthaginians to pray for divine intervention (via child sacrifice), or because bad times increased child mortality, leading to more child burials (via cremation).

Accounts of child sacrifice in Carthage report that beginning at the founding of Carthage in about 814 BC, mothers and fathers buried their children who had been sacrificed to Ba`al Hammon and Tanit in Tophet.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The practice was apparently distasteful even to Carthaginians, and they began to buy children for the purpose of sacrifice or even to raise servant children instead of offering up their own. However, Carthage's priests demanded the flower of their youth in times of crisis or calamity like war, drought or famine. Special ceremonies during extreme crisis saw up to 200 children of the most affluent and powerful families slain and tossed into the burning pyre.{{Citation needed|reason=Long, and detailed, with very relevant information: But badly needs a citation|date=February 2010}}

Skeptics suggest that the bodies of children found in Carthaginian and Phoenician cemeteries were merely the cremated remains of children who died naturally. Sergio Ribichini has argued that the Tophet was &quot;a child necropolis designed to receive the remains of infants who had died prematurely of sickness or other natural causes, and who for this reason were &quot;offered&quot; to specific deities and buried in a place different from the one reserved for the ordinary dead&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sergio Ribichini, &quot;Beliefs and Religious Life&quot; in Moscati, Sabatino (ed), ''The Phoenicians'', 1988, p.141&lt;/ref&gt; The few Carthaginian texts which have survived make absolutely no mention of child sacrifice, though most of them pertain to matters entirely unrelated to religion, such as the practice of agriculture.

{{refimprove|date=May 2011}}The study of the '''history of [[Carthage]]''' is often problematic. Due to the subjugation of the civilization by the Romans at the end of the [[Third Punic War]], very few Carthaginian [[primary source|historical primary sources]] survive. There are a few ancient translations of [[Punic]] texts into Greek and Latin, as well as inscriptions on monuments and buildings discovered in North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Jongeling| first = K.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the majority of available primary source material about Carthaginian civilization was written by [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] historians, such as [[Livy]], [[Polybius]], [[Appian]], [[Cornelius Nepos]], [[Silius Italicus]], [[Plutarch]], [[Dio Cassius]], and [[Herodotus]].

These authors came from cultures which were nearly always in competition, and often in conflict, with Carthage.  The Greeks contested with Carthage for [[Sicily]],&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, V2. pp 165?7&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, and the [[Roman Republic|Romans]] fought the [[Punic Wars]] against Carthage.&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, ''World History'': 1.7?1.60&lt;/ref&gt; Inevitably the accounts of Carthage written by outsiders include significant bias. Recent excavation of ancient Carthaginian sites has brought much more primary material to light. Some of these finds contradict or confirm aspects of the traditional picture of Carthage, but much of the material is still ambiguous.

== Beginning ==
Carthage was one of a number of Phoenician settlements in the western Mediterranean that was created to facilitate trade from the cities of Sidon, Tyre and others from [[Phoenicia]], which was situated in the coast of what is now Lebanon and Palestine. In the [[10th century BC]], the eastern Mediterranean shore was inhabited by various [[Semitic languages|Semitic]]-speaking populations, who had built up flourishing civilizations. The people inhabiting what is now Lebanon, were referred to as ''Phoenicians'' by the [[Greek people|Greeks]]. The [[Phoenician language]] was very close to ancient Hebrew, to such a degree that the latter is often used as an aid in translation of Phoenician inscriptions.

The Phoenician cities were highly dependent on both land- and seaborne trade and their cities included a number of major ports in the area. In order to provide a resting place for their merchant fleets, to maintain a Phoenician monopoly on an area's natural resource, or to conduct trade on its own, the Phoenicians established numerous colonial cities along the coasts of the Mediterranean, stretching from Iberia to the Black Sea. They were stimulated to found their cities by a need for revitalizing trade in order to pay the tribute extracted from [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], [[Sidon]], and [[Byblos]] by the succession of empires that ruled them and later by fear of complete Greek colonization of that part of the Mediterranean suitable for commerce. The initial Phoenician colonization took place during a time when other neighboring kingdoms (Greek, Hittite, Cretan) were suffering from a ?Dark Age?, perhaps after the activities of the [[Sea Peoples]].

===Extent of Phoenician settlement===
The Phoenicians' leading city was [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], which established a number of trading posts around the Mediterranean. Ultimately Phoenicians established 300 colonies in [[Tunisia]], [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], and to a much lesser extent, on the arid coast of [[Libya]]. The Phoenicians lacked the population or necessity to establish self-sustaining cities abroad, and most cities had fewer than 1,000 inhabitants, but Carthage and a few other cities later developed into large, self sustaining, independent cities. The Phoenicians controlled [[Cyprus]], [[Sardinia]], [[Corsica]], and the [[Balearic Islands]], as well as obtained minor possessions in [[Crete]] and [[Sicily]]; the latter settlements were in perpetual conflict with the Greeks. The Phoenicians managed to control Sicily for a limited time, but Phoenician control did not extend inland and was limited to the coast only.

The first colonies were made on the two paths to Iberia's mineral wealth?along the African coast and on Sicily, [[Sardinia]] and the [[Balearic Islands]]. The center of the Phoenician world was Tyre, serving as an economic and political hub. The power of this city waned following numerous sieges and its eventual destruction by [[Alexander the Great]], and the role as leader passed to [[Sidon]], and eventually to Carthage. Each colony paid tribute to either Tyre or Sidon, but neither mother city had actual control of the colonies. This changed with the rise of Carthage, since the Carthaginians appointed their own magistrates to rule the towns and Carthage retained much direct control over the colonies. This policy resulted in a number of Iberian towns siding with the Romans during the [[Punic Wars]].

===Trade===
Ancient sources concur that Carthage had become perhaps the wealthiest city in the world via its trade and commerce, yet few remains of its riches. This is due to the fact that most of it was short-lived materials?[[textiles]], unworked metal, foodstuffs, and [[slaves]]; its trade in fabricated goods was only a part of its wares. There can be no doubt that the most fruitful trade was that acquired from the [[Phoenicians]] in the western [[Mediterranean]], in which [[tin]], [[silver]], [[gold]], and [[iron]] were gained in return for consumer goods.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclop?dia Britannica Online&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation==
Carthage was founded by [[Phoenicia]]n settlers from the city of [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], who brought with them the [[tutelary deity|city-god]] [[Melqart]]. [[Philistos of Syracuse]] dates the founding of Carthage to ''c.'' 1215 BC, while the Roman historian [[Appian]] dates the founding 50 years prior to the [[Trojan War]] (''i.e.'' between 1244 and 1234 BC, according to the chronology of [[Eratosthenes]]). The Roman poet [[Publius Vergilius Maro|Virgil]] imagines that the city's founding coincides with the end of the Trojan War. However, it is most likely that the city was founded sometime between 846 and 813 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Lancel, Serge, ''Carthage: A History'', pp 21-31 ISBN 1-57718-103-4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foundation myths===
According to tradition, the city was founded by Queen [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido]] (or Elissa or Elissar) who fled Tyre following the murder of her husband in an attempt by her younger brother, the King of Tyre, to bolster his own power. A number of foundation myths have survived through [[Greek literature|Greek]] and [[Roman literature]], see [[Byrsa]] for one example.

==== Queen Elissar ====
Queen Elissar (also known as &quot;Elissa&quot;, and by the [[Arabic (language)|Arabic]] name {{lang|ar|??????}} also {{lang|ar|?????}} and {{lang|ar|?????}}) who in later accounts became ''Queen Dido'', was a princess of Tyre who founded the city of Carthage.  At its peak her metropolis came to be called the &quot;shining city&quot;, ruling 300 other cities around the western Mediterranean and leading the Phoenician Punic world.

Elissar was the Princess of Tyre, married to the High Priest of the city, who was wealthy and enjoyed widespread respect and power among the citizens. Details of her life are sketchy and confusing, but the following can be deduced from various sources. According to Justin, Princess Elissar was the daughter of King Matten of Tyre (also known as Muttoial or Belus II). When he died, the throne was jointly bequeathed to her and her brother, [[Pygmalion of Tyre|Pygmalion]]. She married her uncle Acherbas (also known as Sychaeus) High Priest of [[Melqart]], a man with both authority and wealth comparable to the king. Pygmalion was a tyrant, lover of both gold and intrigue, and desired the authority and fortune enjoyed by Acherbas. Pygmalion assassinated Acherbas in the temple and managed to keep the misdeed concealed from his sister for a long time, deceiving her with lies about her husband's death. At the same time, the people of Tyre called for a single [[sovereign]], causing dissent within the royal family.

After learning the truth, Elissar fled Tyre with her husband's gold, and managed to trick the Tyrian ships sent in pursuit to join her fleet. When her ship was overtaken by the Tyrian ships, she threatened to throw the gold overboard and let the would-be captors face the wrath of her brother for failing their mission. They opted to join her, and the augmented fleet sailed on towards the West. Elissa eventually sailed to Africa after a brief stop at Cyprus, where she rescued 80 virgins from a temple. She requested land to establish a new city from the king of the Libyan tribe living near [[Byrsa]] after reaching Africa. Told that she could have as much land that can be covered by an oxhide, she cut the hide into thin strips and managed to surround the hill of Byrsa. The initial city of Carthage was founded on the spot. When the Libyan king later sought to marry her, which would have caused the city to become part of the king's domain, she chose instead to kill herself.

==== Queen Dido ====
In the ''[[Aeneid]]'', Virgil gives a tale of how Queen Dido of Carthage - which had become a prosperous kingdom under her rule - meets the Trojan hero [[Aeneas]] who himself has fled the sack of [[Troy]] with a small band of Trojans to settle in the west. Dido and Aeneas fall in love, but when the Trojans depart Carthage for Italy (as is their destiny), Dido commits suicide. At the same time she curses Aeneas and all his future descendants and countrymen - the future Romans.

== Colony of Tyre ==
Little is known of the internal history and dealings of the early Phoenician city.  The initial city covered the area around Byrsa, paid an annual tribute to the nearby Libyan tribes, and may have been ruled by a governor from Tyre, whom the Greeks identified as &quot;king&quot;.  [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]], then the leading Phoenician city in Africa, aided the early settlement in her dealings. The date from which Carthage can be counted as an independent power cannot exactly be determined, and probably nothing distinguished Carthage from the other Phoenician colonies in Africa during 800 - 700 BC.

It has been noted that the culture of Phoenician colonies had gained a distinct &quot;Punic&quot; characteristic by the end of the 7th century BC, indicating the emergence of a distinct culture in Western Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;Lancel, Serge, Carthage A History, pp 81-83 ISBN 1-57718-103-4&lt;/ref&gt; In 650 BC, Carthage planted her own colony,&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus, 5.15.2-3&lt;/ref&gt; and in 600 BC, she was warring with Greeks on her own away from the African mainland. By the time King [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] of Babylon was conducting the 13-year siege of Tyre starting from 585 BC, Carthage was probably independent of her mother city in political matters. However, close ties with Tyre still remained, Carthage continued to send annual tribute to Tyre (for the temple of Melqart) at irregular intervals over the centuries. Carthage inherited no colonial empire from Tyre and had to build her own. It is likely that Carthage did not have an empire prior to 6th century BC.

Exactly what social/political/geographic/military factors influenced the citizens of Carthage, and not the other Mediterranean Phoenician colonial members to create an economic and political hegemony is not clearly known. The city of Utica was far older than Carthage and enjoyed the same geographical/political advantages as Carthage, but it opted to be an allied entity, not a leader of the Punic hegemony that came into being probably sometime around the 6th century BC. When the Phoenician trade monopoly was challenged by [[Etruscans]] and Greeks in the west and their political and economic independence by successive empires in the east, Phoenician influence from the mainland decreased in the west and Punic Carthage ultimately emerged at the head of a commercial empire. One theory is that refugees from Phoenicia swelled the population and enhanced the culture of Carthage during the time the Phoenician homeland came under attack from the Babylonians and Persians, transferring the tradition of Tyre to Carthage.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, G.P, Hannibal, pp 10-11 ISBN 0-8154-1005-0&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginning of Carthaginian Hegemony==
The mainland Greeks began their colonization efforts in the western Mediterranean with the founding of [[Naxos (Sicily)|Naxos]] and [[Cumae]] in Sicily and Italy respectively, and by 650 BC Phoenicians in Sicily had retreated to the western part of that island. Around this time the first recorded independent action by Carthage takes place, which is the colonization of [[Ibiza]]. By the end of the [[7th century BC]], Carthage was becoming one of the leading commercial centers of the West Mediterranean region, a position it retained until overthrown by the [[Roman Republic]]. Carthage would establish new colonies, repopulate old Phoenician ones, come to the defense of other Punic cities under threat from natives/Greeks, as well as expand her territories by conquest. While some Phoenician colonies willingly submitted to Carthage, paying [[tribute]] and giving up their [[foreign policy]], others in Iberia and Sardinia resisted Carthaginian efforts.

Carthage, unlike [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], did not concentrate on conquering lands adjacent to the city prior to embarking on overseas ventures. Her dependence on trade and focus on protecting that trade network saw the evolution of an overseas hegemony before Carthage pushed inland into Africa. It may be possible that the power of the Libyan tribes prevented expansion in the neighborhood of the city for some time.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, Titus, 34.62.12&lt;/ref&gt; Until 550 BC, Carthage paid rent to the Libyans for use of land in the city surroundings&lt;ref&gt;Justin, 17.5.14&lt;/ref&gt; and in Cape Bon for agricultural purposes. The Africa dominion controlled by Carthage was relatively small. The payment would be finally stopped around 450 BC, when the second major expansion inland into Tunisia would take place. Carthage probably colonized the [[Gulf of Gab?s|Syrtis]] region (Area between [[Thapsus]] in Tunisia and [[Sabratha]] in Libya) between 700-600 BC. Carthage also focused on bringing the existing Phoenician colonies along the African coast into the hegemony, but exact details are lacking. Emporia had fallen under Carthaginian influence prior to 509 BC, as the first treaty with Rome indicated. The eastward expansion of Carthaginian influence along the African coast (through what is now Libya) was blocked by the Greek colony of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] (established 630 BC).

Carthage spread her influence along the west coast relatively unhindered, but the chronology is unknown. Wars with the Libyans, Numidians and [[Mauri]] took place but did not end with the creation of a Carthaginian empire like the one the Romans created almost half a millennium later.

=== Nature of the Hegemony ===
The degree of control Carthage exerted over her territories varied in their severity. In ways, the Carthaginian hegemony shared some of the characteristics of the [[Delian League]] (allies sharing defense expenditure), the [[Sparta|Spartan Kingdom]] (serfs tilling for the Punic elite and state) and to a lesser extent, the [[Roman Republic]] (allies contributing manpower/tribute to furnish the Roman war machine).

==== Conquered People ====
The African lands near to the city faced the harshest control measures, with Carthaginian officers administering the area and Punic troops garrisoning the cities. Many cities had to destroy their defensive walls, while the Libyans living in the area had few rights. The Libyans could own land&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus, 20.8.3-4&lt;/ref&gt; but had to pay an annual tribute (50% of agricultural produce and 25% of their town income) and serve in the Carthaginian armies as conscripts.

==== Tributary Allies ====
Other Phoenician cities (Like [[Leptis Magna]]) paid an annual tribute and ran their own internal affairs, retained their defensive walls but had no independent foreign policy. Other cities had to provide personnel for the Punic army and the Punic navy along with tribute but retained internal autonomy. Allies like Utica and [[Gades]] were more independent and had their own government. Carthage stationed troops and some type of central administration in Sardinia and Iberia to control her domain. The cities, in return for surrendering these privileges, obtained Carthaginian protection, which provided the fleet to combat [[piracy]] and fought wars needed to protect these cities from external threats.

====Citizens and their status====
Carthaginian citizenship was more exclusive and the goal of the state was more focused on protecting the trade infrastructure than expanding the citizen body. The [[Roman Republic]], which in the course of her wars created an alliance system in Italy which, in addition to expanding her lands, also expanded her citizen body and military manpower by adding allies (with varying degrees of political rights). Carthage, while she continued to expand until 218 BC, did not have a similar system to increase her citizen numbers. She had treaties in place with various Punic and non-Punic cities (the most famous and well known ones being the ones with Rome), which detailed the rights of each power and their [[sphere of influence]]. The Punic cities not under direct Carthaginian control probably had similar treaties in place. The Libyo-Phoenicians, who lived in the African domain controlled by Carthage also had rights similar to those of Carthaginian citizens. The Carthaginian citizens were exempt from taxation and primarily involved in commerce as traders or industrial workers. As a result, Carthage, unlike the other agricultural nations, could not afford to have her citizens serve in a long war, as it diminished her commercial activities.

==The reign of &quot;Kings&quot;==
Carthage was initially ruled by &quot;kings&quot;, who were elected by the Carthaginian &quot;senate&quot; and served for a specific time period. The election took place in Carthage, and the kings at first were war leaders, civic administrators and performed certain religious duties. According to [[Aristotle]], kings were elected on merit, not by the people but by the senate, and the post was not hereditary. However, the crown and military commands could also be purchased by the highest bidder. Initially these kings may have enjoyed near absolute power, which was curtailed as Carthage moved towards a more democratic government. Gradually, military command fell to professional officers, and a pair of suffets replaced the king in some of the civic functions and eventually kings were no longer elected. Records show that two families had held the kingship with distinction during 550-310 BC. The [[Magonids|Magonid family]] produced several members who were elected kings between 550 BC and 370 BC, who were in the forefront of the overseas expansion of Carthage. Hanno &quot;Magnus&quot;, along with his son and grandson, held the kingship for some years between 367 and 310 BC. Records of other elected kings or their impact on Carthaginian history are not available. The [[Shofet|suffets]], who would ultimately displace the kings, were elected by the people. Suffets would ultimately discard their military duties and become purely civic officials.

The Phoenicians encountered little resistance in developing their trade [[monopoly]] during 1100-900 BC. The emergence of the Etruscans as a sea power did little to dent the Phoenician trade. The power of the Etruscans was localized around Italy, and their trade with Corsica, Sardinia and Iberia had not hindered Phoenician activity. Trade had also developed between Punic and Etruscan cities, and Carthage had treaties with the Etruscan cities to regulate these activities, while mutual piracy had not led to full-blown war between the powers. Carthage's economic successes, and its dependence on shipping to conduct most of its trade, led to the creation of a powerful Carthaginian navy to discourage both pirates and rival nations. This, coupled with its success and growing hegemony, ultimately brought Carthage into increasing conflict with the [[Greeks]], the other major power contending for control of the central Mediterranean. In conducting these conflicts, which spanned between 600 - 310 BC, the overseas empire of Carthage also came into being under the military leadership of the &quot;kings&quot;. The Etruscans, also in conflict with the Greeks, became allies of Carthage in the ensuing struggle.

===Conflict with the Greeks===
{{Campaignbox Carthaginian Expansion}}

The nature of the conflict between Carthage and the Greeks was more due to economic factors rather than ideological and cultural differences. The Greeks did not wage a crusade to save the world from ''Imperium Barbaricum'' but to extend their own area of influence, neither was Carthage interested in wiping out Greek ideals. It was the vulnerability of the Carthaginian economy to Greek commercial competition that caused Carthage to take on the Greeks during the early years of her empire.

====Vulnerability of Punic trade====
The trade network which Carthage inherited from Tyre depended heavily on Carthage keeping commercial rivals at arm's length. The goods produced by Carthage were mainly for the local African market&lt;ref&gt;Markoe, Glenn E., Phoenicians, pp 104-05 ISBN 0-520-22614-3&lt;/ref&gt; and were initially inferior to Greek goods. Carthage was the middleman between mineral resource-rich Iberia and the east. She bartered low-priced goods for metals, then bartered those for finished goods in the east and distributed these through their network. The threat from the Greek colonists was threefold:
*Undercutting the Phoenicians by offering better products
*Taking over the distribution network
*Preying on Punic shipping

While the Greek colonies also offered increased opportunities for trade and piracy, their nosing into areas of Punic influence caused the Punic cities to look for protection from their strongest city. Carthage took up the challenge.

===Greeks go West===
The Greek colonization in the Western Mediterranean started with the establishment of [[Cumae]] in Italy and [[Naxos (Sicily)|Naxos]] in Sicily after 750 BC. Over the next century, hundreds of Greek colonies sprang up along the Southern Italian and Sicilian coastlines (except Western Sicily). There are no records of Phoenicians initially clashing with Greeks over territory; in fact, the Phoenicians had withdrawn to the Western corner of Sicily in the face of Greek expansion. However, the situation changed sometime after 638 BC, when the first Greek trader visited [[Tartessos]], and by 600 BC Carthage was actively warring with the Greeks to curb their colonial expansion. By 600 BC, the once-Phoenician lake had turned into a conflict zone with the Greeks rowing about in all corners. Carthaginian interests in Iberia, Sardinia and Sicily were threatened, which led to a series of conflicts between Carthage and various Greek city-states.

Twenty years after the establishment of [[Massalia]], the Phoenician cities in Sicily repelled an invasion of Dorian Greek settlers in Sicily while aiding the [[Elymian]]s of [[Segesta]] against the Greek city of [[Selineus]] in 580 BC. The result was the defeated Greeks establishing themselves in Lipera, which became a pirate hub, a threat to all commerce (Greek included). Shortly after this event, Carthaginians under a &quot;king&quot; called Malchus warred successfully against the Libyan tribes in Africa, and then defeated the Greeks in Sicily, sending a part of the Sicilian booty to Tyre as tribute to Melquart. Malchus next moved to Sardinia, but suffered a severe defeat against the natives. He and his entire army were banished by the Carthaginian senate. They in turn returned to Africa and besieged Carthage, which duly surrendered. Malchus assumed power, but was later deposed and executed. The Carthaginian army, which up to this point had been a predominantly citizen militia, became one primarily made up of mercenaries.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, G.P, Hannibal, pp 12-13,ISBN 0-8154-1005-0&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cyrene and Carthage====
No records of any confrontations between the two powers are available, but a legend describes how the powers agreed on a border in [[Libya]].

Two pairs of champions set out for Carthage and Cyrene on the same day, each pair running towards the other city. When the runners met, the Carthaginian pair had covered more ground. Accused of cheating by the Greeks, they consented to be buried alive on the meeting spot, so that the territory between that spot and Carthage would become part of the Carthaginian domain. The Carthaginian champions were brothers, called  Philaenus, and the border was marked by two pillars called the &quot;Altars of the Philaeni&quot;. The African territorial boundary between the Western and Eastern Roman Empires was later set on this spot.&lt;ref&gt;Lancel, Serge, ''Carthage: A History'', pp 92-94 ISBN 1-57718-103-4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mago and the Magonids===
[[Mago I of Carthage|Mago I]], a general of the army, had assumed power in Carthage by 550 BC. Mago and his sons, [[Hasdrubal I of Carthage|Hasdrubal I]] and [[Hamilcar I of Carthage|Hamilcar I]], established the warlike tradition of Carthage by their successes in Africa, Sicily and Sardinia.&lt;ref&gt;Justin, XIX, pp 1-2&lt;/ref&gt; In 546 BC, Phocaeans fleeing from a Persian invasion established [[Alalia]] in Corsica (Greeks had settled there since 562 BC), and began preying on Etruscan and Punic commerce. Between 540 and 535 BC, a Carthaginian-Etruscan alliance had expelled the Greeks from Corsica after the [[Battle of Alalia]]. The Etruscans took control of Corsica, Carthage concentrated on Sardinia, ensuring that no Greek presence would be established in the island. The defeat also ended the westward expansion of Greeks for all time.

A war with Greek Massalia followed. Carthage lost battles but managed to safeguard Phoenician Iberia and close the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] to Greek shipping,&lt;ref&gt;Casson, Lionel, The Ancient Mariners, pp 74-75, ISBN 0-691-01477-9&lt;/ref&gt; while Massalians retained their Iberian colonies in Eastern Iberia above Cape Nao.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, G.P, Hannibal, p 11, ISBN 0-8154-1005-0&lt;/ref&gt; Southern Iberia was closed to the Greeks. Carthaginians in support of the Phoenician colony [[Gades]] in Iberia,&lt;ref&gt;Justin, XLIII, 5, 2-3&lt;/ref&gt; also brought about the collapse of [[Tartessos]] in Iberia by 530 BC, either by armed conflict or by cutting off Greek trade. Carthage also besieged and took over Gades at this time. The Persians had taken over Cyrene by this time, and Carthage may have been spared a trial of arms against the Persian Empire when the Phoenicians refused to lend ships to [[Cambyses]] in 525 BC for an African expedition. Carthage may have paid tribute irregularly to the Great King. It is not known if Carthage had any role in the [[Battle of Cumae]] in 524 BC, after which Etruscan power began to wane in Italy.

Hasdrubal, the son of Mago, was elected as &quot;king&quot; eleven times, was granted a triumph four times (the only Carthaginian to receive this honor - there is no record of anyone else being given similar treatment by Carthage) and had died of his battle wounds received in Sardinia.&lt;ref&gt;Justin, XIX, p 2&lt;/ref&gt; Carthage had engaged in a 25-year struggle in Sardinia, where the natives may have received aid from [[Sybaris]], then the richest city in Magna Gracia and an ally of the Phocaeans. The Carthaginians faced resistance from [[Nora, Italy|Nora]] and [[Sulci]] in Sardinia, while [[Carales]] and [[Tharros]] had submitted willingly to Carthaginian rule.&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.isolasarda.com/nora-storia_e.htm] History of Nora&lt;/ref&gt; Hasdrubal?s war against the Libyans failed to stop the annual tribute payment.&lt;ref&gt;Lancel, Serge, Carthage A History, p 257, ISBN 1-57718-103-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Carthaginians managed to defeat and drive away the colonization attempt near Leptis Manga in Libya by the Spartan prince [[Dorieus]] after a three-year war (514-511 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Lancel, Serge, Carthage A History, pp 91-93, ISBN 1-57718-103-4&lt;/ref&gt; Dorieus was later defeated and killed at [[Eryx]] in Sicily in 510 BC while attempting to establish a foothold in Western Sicily. Hamilcar, either the brother or nephew (son of Hanno)&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, VII, p 165&lt;/ref&gt; of Hasdrubal, followed him to power in Carthage. Hamilcar had served with Hasdrubal in Sardinia and had managed to put down the revolt of Sardinians which had started in 509 BC.

====Treaty with Rome====
{{main|Treaties between Rome and Carthage}}

Carthage had concluded treaties with several powers, but those with Rome are the most well known. In [[509 BC]], a treaty was signed between Carthage and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] indicating a division of influence and commercial activities. This is the first known source indicating that Carthage had gained control over [[Sicily]] and [[Sardinia]], as well as Emporia and the area south of [[Cape Bon]] in Africa. Carthage may have signed the treaty with Rome, then an insignificant backwater, because Romans had treaties with the Phocaeans and Cumae, who were aiding the Roman struggle against the Etruscans at that time. Carthage had similar treaties with Etruscan, Punic and Greek cities in Sicily.

By the end of the [[6th Century BC]], Carthage had conquered most of the old Phoenician colonies e.g. [[Hadrumetum]], [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]] and [[Kerkouane]], subjugated some of the [[Ancient Libya|Libyan]] tribes, and had taken control of parts of the North African coast from modern [[Morocco]] to the borders of [[Cyrenaica]]. It was also fighting wars in defense of Punic colonies and commerce. However, only the details of her struggle against the Greeks have survived - which often makes Carthage seem &quot;obsessed with Sicily&quot;.

====First Sicilian War====

The island of Sicily, lying at Carthage's doorstep, became the arena in which this conflict played out. From their earliest days, both the Greeks and Phoenicians had been attracted to the large island, establishing a large number of colonies and trading posts along its coasts. Small battles had been fought between these settlements for centuries. Carthage had to contend with at least three Greek incursions, in 580 BC, in 510 BC and a war in which the city of Heraclea was destroyed. [[Gelo]] had fought in the last war and had secured terms for the Greeks.

The Punic domain in Sicily by 500 BC contained the cities of Motya, [[Panormus]] and [[Soluntum]]. By 490 BC, Carthage had concluded treaties with the Greek cities of [[Selinus]], [[Himera]], and [[Zankle]] in Sicily. Gelo, the [[tyrant]] of Greek [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], backed in part by support from other Greek [[city-states]], had been attempting to unite the island under his rule since 485 BC. When [[Theron]] of Akragas, father-in-law of Gelo, deposed the tyrant of Himera in 483 BC, Carthage decided to intervene at the instigation of the tyrant of [[Rhegion]], who was the father-in-law of the deposed tyrant of Himera.

Hamilcar prepared the largest Punic overseas expedition to date and, after three years of preparations, sailed for Sicily. This enterprise coincided with the expedition of [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] against mainland Greece in 480 BC, prompting speculations about a possible alliance between Carthage and Persia against the Greeks, although no documentary evidence of this exists. The Punic fleet was battered by storms en route, and the Punic army was destroyed and Hamilcar killed in the [[Battle of Himera (480 BC)|Battle of Himera]] by the combined armies of Himera, Akragas and Syracuse under Gelo. Carthage made peace with the Greeks and paid a large indemnity of 2000 silver talents, but lost no territory in Sicily.

==A republican empire==
This defeat had far reaching consequences, both political and economic, for Carthage. Politically, the old government of entrenched nobility was ousted, replaced by the Carthaginian Republic. The ?King? was still elected, but their power began to erode, with the senate and the &quot;Tribunal of 104&quot; gaining dominance in political matters, and the position of &quot;Suffet&quot; becoming more influential. Economically, sea-borne trade with the Middle East was cut off by the mainland Greeks&lt;ref&gt;Thucidides, VI, p34&lt;/ref&gt; and Magna Gracia boycotted Carthaginian traders. This led to the development of trade with the West and of caravan-borne trade with the East. Gisco, son of Hamilcar was exiled, and Carthage for the next 70 years made no recorded forays against the Greeks nor aided either the Elymians/Sicels or the Etruscans, then locked in struggle against the Greeks, or sent any aid to the Greek enemies of Syracuse, then the leading Greek city in Sicily. Based on this abstinence from Greek affairs, it is assumed that Carthage was crippled after the defeat of Himera.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, G.P, Hannibal, p 16-18, ISBN 0-8154-1005-0&lt;/ref&gt;

===How far crippled?===
If Carthage was indeed crippled, she was not immobile. Focus was shifted on expansion in Africa and Sardinia, and on the exploration of Africa and Europe for new markets. The grandsons of Mago I, Hannibal, Hasdrubal and Sappho (sons of Hasdrubal), together with Hanno, Gisco and Himilco (sons of Hamilcar) are said to have played prominent parts in these activities,&lt;ref&gt;Justin XIX pp 1-4&lt;/ref&gt; but specific details of their roles are lacking. By 450 BC, Carthage had finally stopped paying tribute to the Libyans,&lt;ref&gt;Lancel, Serge, Carthage A History, pp 256-258, ISBN 1-57718-103-4&lt;/ref&gt; and a line of forts was built in Sardinia, securing Carthaginian control over the island coastline.

Hanno, son of Hamilcar may be the famous [[Hanno the Navigator]],&lt;ref&gt;Heeren, IV p 539&lt;/ref&gt; which places his expedition around 460&amp;ndash;425 BC, and Himilco may be the same as [[Himilco the Navigator]],&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, H.N. II, p 67&lt;/ref&gt; which puts his expedition sometimes after 450 BC. Hanno the Navigator sailed down the African coast as far as Cameroon, and Himilco the Navigator explored the European Atlantic coast up to England in search of tin. These expeditions took place when Carthage was at the zenith of its power.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, H.N. II p 67, VI p 36&lt;/ref&gt; If Hanno and Himilco are indeed related to Mago, then Carthage had recovered quite rapidly from her &quot;crippled&quot; state. If Hanno and Himilco are not of the Magoniod family, then these expeditions may have taken place before 500 BC and Cathage might have been crippled for 70 years.

Carthage took no known part in the activities of the Sicilian chief [[Ducetius]] in Sicily against Syracuse, nor in the wars between Akrages and Syracuse, or the battles of the Etruscans against Syracuse and Cumae. Carthage's fleet also took no recorded part in the shattering defeat of the Etruscan fleet at the naval [[Battle of Cumae]] in 474 BC at the hands of the Greeks. She sat out the [[Peloponnesian War]], refused to aid Segesta against Selinus in 415 BC and Athens against Syracuse in 413 BC. Nothing is known of any military activities Carthage might have taken in Africa or Iberia during this time. In 410 BC, Segesta, under attack from Selinus, appealed to Carthage again. The Carthaginian senate agreed to send help.

By [[410 BC]], Carthage had conquered much of modern day [[Tunisia]], strengthened and founded new colonies in North Africa, and had sponsored [[Mago Barca]]'s journey across the [[Sahara Desert]], Although, in that year, the Iberian colonies seceded ? cutting off Carthage's major supply of [[silver]] and [[copper]].

== The Sicilian see-saw ==
{{further2|the [[Sicilian Wars]]}}

===Second Sicilian War===
&quot;King&quot; Hannibal Mago (son of Gisco and grandson of Hamilcar, who had died at Himera in 480 BC), led a small force to Sicily to aid Segesta, and defeated  the army of Selinus in 410 BC. Hannibal Mago invaded Sicily with a larger force in 409 BC, landed at Motya and stormed Selinus (modern [[Selinunte]]); which fell before Syracuse could intervene effectively. Hannibal then attacked and destroyed [[Himera]] despite Syracusan intervention. 3,000 Greek prisoners were executed by Hannibal after the battle to avenge the death of Hamilcar at Himera, and the city was utterly destroyed. The Carthaginians did not attack Syracuse or Akragus, but departed for Africa with the spoils of war, and a three-year lull fell in Sicily.

In retaliation for Greek raids on Punic Sicilian possessions in [[406 BC]],  Hannibal Mago led a second Carthaginian expedition, perhaps aiming to subjugate all Sicily. Carthaginians first moved against Akragas, during the [[siege]] of which the Carthaginian forces were ravaged by plague, Hannibal Mago himself succumbing to it. His kinsman and successor, [[Himilco]] (the son of Hanno&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus, XIV, p41&lt;/ref&gt;), successfully captured Akragus, then captured the cities of [[Gela]] and [[Camarina]] while repeatedly defeating the army of [[Dionysius I of Syracuse|Dionysius]], the new tyrant of Syracuse, in battle. Himilco ultimately concluded a treaty with Dionysius (an outbreak of plague may have caused this), which allowed the Greek settlers to return to Selinus, Akragus, Camarina and Gela, but these were made tributary to Carthage. The Elymian and Sicel cities were kept free of both Punic and Greek dominion, and Dionysius, who had usurped power in Syracuse, was confirmed as tyrant of Syracuse. The home-bound Punic army carried the plague back to Carthage.

Dionysius ruled for 38 years and engaged in four wars against Carthage with varying results. In [[398 BC]], after building up the power of Syracuse while Carthage was suffering from the plague, Dionysius broke the peace treaty. His soldiers massacred the Carthaginian traders in Syracuse, and Dionysius then besieged, captured and destroyed the Carthaginian city of [[Motya]] in Western Sicily while foiling the relief effort of Himilco through a brilliant stratagem. Himilco, who had been elected &quot;king&quot;, responded decisively the following year, leading an expedition which not only reclaimed Motya, but also captured [[Messina, Italy|Messina]]. Finally, he laid siege to Syracuse itself after Mago, his kinsman, crushed the Greek fleet off Catana. The siege met with great success throughout 397 BC, but in 396 BC plague ravaged the Carthaginian forces, and they collapsed under Syracusan attack. Himilco paid an indemnity of 300 talents for safe passage of Carthaginian citizens to Dionysius. He abandoned his mercenaries and sailed to Carthage, only to commit suicide after publicly assuming full responsibility for the debacle (After his death, the power of &quot;kings&quot; would be severely curtailed, and the power of the oligarchy, ruling through the &quot;Council of Elders&quot; and the newly created &quot;Tribunal of 104,&quot; correspondingly increased).&lt;ref&gt;Lancel, Serge, Carthage A History, p 114, ISBN 1-57718-103-4&lt;/ref&gt;

The plague, brought back from Sicily, ravaged Carthage and a severe rebellion in Africa occurred at the same time. Carthage was besieged and her naval power was crucial in supplying the city. Himilco was succeeded by his kinsman Mago, who was occupied with subduing the rebellion while Dionysius consolidated his power in Sicily. The next clash against Carthage took place during 393 BC. Mago, in an attempt to aid the Sicels under attack from Syracuse, was defeated by Dionysius. Carthage reinforced Mago in 392 BC, but before he could engage the forces of Dionysius the Sicels had switched sides. The Carthaginian army was outmaneuvered by Dionysius, and peace soon followed, which allowed Carthage to retain her domain in Sicily while allowing Syracuse a free hand against the Sicels. The treaty lasted nine years.

Dionysius began the next war in 383 BC, but details of the first 4 years of clashes are unavailable. Carthage sent a force under Mago to Southern Italy for the first time to aid Italian Greeks against Syracuse in 379 BC. The expedition met with success, but during the same year, Libyans and Sardinians revolted, and a plague again swept through Africa. The stalemate in Sicily was broken when Dionysius defeated and killed Mago at the battle of Cabala in 378 BC (Mago was the last &quot;suffet&quot; to lead troops personally in battle. The Magonid dynasty ended with the death of his son Himilco).

Carthage initiated peace negotiations, which dragged for a year but ultimately faltered. Dionysius had consolidated his gains during the lull, and attacked Punic Sicily. He was decisively defeated in the battle of Cronium in 376 BC by Himilco, the son of Mago. Carthage did not follow up the victory but settled for  an indemnity payment of 1000 talents and restoration of  Carthaginian holdings in Sicily.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, G.P, Hannibal, pp 20-21, ISBN 0-8154-1005-0&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing is known of how or when Carthage subdued the African and Sardinian rebellion.

Dionysius initiated hostilities again in 368 BC, and after initial successes besieged [[Lilybaeum]], but the defeat of his fleet at [[Drepanum]] led to a stalemate and the war ended with his death in 367 BC. Carthaginian holdings west of the Halycas river remained secure. Hanno, a wealthy aristocrat, was in command in Sicily, and he and his family played a leading role in the politics of Carthage for the next fifty years. Carthage had entered into an alliance with the Etruscans, while [[Tarentum]] and Syracuse concluded a similar treaty.

==Hanno &quot;Magnus&quot;==
A power struggle saw Hanno eventually depose his rival Suniatus (Leader of the Council of Elders) through the judicial process and execute him).&lt;ref&gt;Lancel, Serge, Carthage A History, p 115, ISBN 1-57718-103-4&lt;/ref&gt; With Sicily secure, Carthage launched campaigns in Libya, Spain and Mauretania, which eventually earned Hanno the title &quot;Magnus&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus, XX,5, XXI, 4&lt;/ref&gt; along with great wealth, while Hamilcar and Gisco, his sons, served with distinction in the campaigns. However, Hanno aimed to obtain total power and planned to overthrow the &quot;Council of Elders&quot;. His scheme failed, leading to his execution along with Hamilcar and most of his family. Gisco was exiled.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus, XVI, 8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treaty with Rome===
Carthage and Rome (by now a significant power in Central Italy), concluded a second treaty in 348 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Lazanby, J.F, The First Punic War, pp 31-33, ISBN 1-85728-136-5&lt;/ref&gt; Romans were allowed to trade in Sicily, but not to settle there, and Iberia, Sardinia and Libya were forbidden to Roman exploration, trade and settlement activities. Romans were to hand over any settlements they captured there to Carthage. Carthaginians pledged to be friendly with the Latins, and return to Rome cities captured in [[Latium]] (The Latin League would be incorporated into the Roman Republic by 338 BC), and not to spend the night in Roman territory under arms.  This shows that the Iberian Phoenician colonies were in the Carthaginian &quot;Sphere of Influence&quot; by 348 BC.

===Sicily Again===
The death of Dionysius ultimately led to a power struggle between [[Dion of Syracuse|Dion]], [[Dionysius II of Syracuse]] and other aspirants.
The Punic holdings in Sicily were secure as Syracuse had begun to lose its hegemony over other Sicilian cities because of internal political conflict that turned to open warfare. Carthage had done little directly during 366 -346 BC to interfere, but in 343 BC decided to oppose [[Timoleon]]. Carthaginian army and fleet activity failed to stop his assumption of power in Syracuse. Mago, the Carthaginian commander, had the advantage of numbers, the support of allied Greeks, and was even admitted into Syracuse. But he bungled so much that he killed himself instead of facing the tribunal of 104 after returning to Carthage.

Timoleon managed to gain support of the tyrants in league with Carthage, and the Punic expedition sent to Sicily in retaliation of Syracusan raids was crushed in the [[Battle of the Crimissus]] in 341 BC by the combined Greek force. Gisco, the son of Hanno &quot;Magnus&quot; was recalled and elected as &quot;king&quot;, but he achieved little and after Timoleon had captured some pro-Carthaginian Greek cities, a peace treaty was concluded in 338 BC. The accord left the Punic possessions in Sicily unchanged,&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus, XVI, 81-82&lt;/ref&gt; with Syracuse free to deal with other cities in Sicily.

==Alexander and the Diadochi==
While Carthage was engaged in Sicily, the rise of Macedon under [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] and [[Alexander the Great]] saw the defeat of Greek city states and the fall of the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. All the mainland Phoenician cities had submitted to Alexander except Tyre, which was besieged and sacked in 332 BC, while the Carthaginian citizens present in the city were spared. Carthage sent two delegations to Alexander, one in 332 BC and another in 323 BC, but little was achieved. Alexander was raising a fleet in Cilicia for the invasion of Carthage, Italy and Iberia when he died, sparing Carthage an ordeal. Battles among the Diadochi and the ultimate 3 way struggle between Antagonid Macedon, Ptolemic Egypt and Selucid Syria spared Carthage any further clashes with the successor states for some time. Trade relations were opened with Egypt, giving Carthage sea-bourne access to the Eastern markets, which were cut-off since 480 BC.

===Third Sicilian War (315 BC?307 BC) ===
In [[315 BC]], [[Agathocles]], the tyrant of Syracuse and considered as one of the Diadochi, seized the city of [[Messene]] (present-day Messina). In [[311 BC]] he invaded the Carthaginian holdings on Sicily, breaking the terms of the current peace treaty, and laid siege to [[Agrigentum|Akragas]]. [[Hamilcar]], grandson of Hanno &quot;Magnus&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus, XIX, p106-110&lt;/ref&gt; led the Carthaginian response and met with tremendous success. By [[310 BC]], he controlled almost all of Sicily and had blockaded Syracuse itself.

In desperation, Agathocles secretly led an expedition of 14,000 men to the mainland, hoping to save his rule by leading a counterstrike against Carthage itself. The expedition ravaged Carthaginian possessions in Africa. Troops recalled from Sicily under the joint command of Hanno and Bomilcar (two political rivals) were defeated by Agathocles, Hanno himself falling in battle. Ophellas, one of the Diadochi, came from Cyrene with 10,000 troops to aid the Syracusans. Agathocles eventually murdered Ophellas and took over his army. Although the Greeks eventually managed to capture Utica, Carthage continued to resist, and Syracuse remained blockaded.

In Sicily, Hamilcar led a night attack on Syracuse, which failed, leading to his capture and subsequent execution by the Syracusans. Agathocles returned to Syracuse in 308 BC and defeated the Punic army, thus lifting the blockade, then returned to Africa. In 307, the war came to an end when Carthage finally managed to defeat the Greeks in Africa, after surviving a coup attempt by Bomilcar. Agathocles abandoned his army and returned to Syracuse, where a treaty divided Sicily between Punic and Greek domains.

===Treaty with Rome===
Carthage and Rome signed another treaty in 306 BC, according to the Greek historian [[Philinus of Agrigentum|Philinus]]. The main feature of this treaty is the agreement by Rome not to interfere in Sicily and Carthage not to exert influence over events in Italy. The historian Polybius considers this treaty a forgery.

===Pyrrhic War===
{{main|Pyrrhic War}}
Between [[280 BC|280]] and [[275 BC]], [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]] waged two major campaigns in an effort to protect and extend the influence of the Macedonians in the western Mediterranean: one against the emerging power of the [[Roman Republic]] in southern Italy, the other against Carthage in Sicily.

The Greek city of Tarentum had attacked and sacked the city of [[Thruii]] and expelled the newly installed Roman garrison in 282 BC. Committed to war, they appealed to Pyrrhus, who ultimately arrived with an army and defeated the Romans in the [[Battle of Heraclea]] and the [[Battle of Asculum]]. In the midst of Pyrrhus' Italian campaigns, he received envoys from the Sicilian cities of [[Agrigentum]], [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], and [[Leontini]], asking for military aid to remove the Carthaginian dominance over that island.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Pyrrhus'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pyrrhus*.html#22 22:1?22:3]&lt;/ref&gt;

Carthage had attacked Syracuse and besieged the city after seizing Akragus. Mago, the Carthaginian admiral, had 100 ships blockading the city. Pyrrhus agreed to intervene, and sailed for Sicily. Mago lifted the siege and Pyrrhus fortified the Sicilian cities with an army of 20,000 [[infantry]], 3,000 [[cavalry]] and 20 war elephants, supported by some 200 ships. Initially, Pyrrhus' Sicilian campaign against Carthage was a success, pushing back the Carthaginian forces, and capturing the city-fortress of [[Erice|Eryx]], even though he was not able to capture [[Lilybaeum]].&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Pyrrhus '', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pyrrhus*.html#22 22:4?22:6]&lt;/ref&gt; After a two-month siege, Pyrrhus withdrew.

Following these losses, Carthage sued for peace, but Pyrrhus refused unless Carthage was willing to renounce its claims on Sicily entirely. According to [[Plutarch]], Pyrrhus set his sights on conquering Carthage itself, and to this end, began outfitting an expedition. The Carthaginians fought a battle outside Lilybaeum in 276 BC, and lost.

The ruthless treatment of the Sicilian cities in his preparations for this expedition, and the execution of two Sicilian rulers whom Pyrrhus claimed were plotting against him, led to such a rise in animosity towards the Greeks that Pyrrhus withdrew from Sicily and returned to deal with events occurring in southern Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Pyrrhus '', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pyrrhus*.html#23 Chapter 23]&lt;/ref&gt; The fleet of Pyhrrus was defeated by Carthage, the Greeks losing 70 ships in the battle.

Pyrrhus' campaigns in Italy were futile, and Pyrrhus eventually withdrew to Epirus. For Carthage, this meant a return to the status quo. For Rome, however, the failure of Pyrrhus to defend the colonies of ''[[Magna Graecia]]'' meant that Rome absorbed them into its &quot;[[sphere of influence]]&quot;, bringing it closer to complete domination of the Italian peninsula. Rome's domination of Italy, and proof that Rome could pit its military strength successfully against major international powers, would pave the way to the future Rome-Carthage conflicts of the [[Punic Wars]].

==The Punic Wars==
{{further2|[[Punic Wars]]|[[First Punic War]]|[[Mercenary War]]|[[Second Punic War]]|[[Third Punic War]]}}

When Agathocles died in [[288 BC]], a large company of Italian mercenaries who had previously been held in his service found themselves suddenly without employment. Rather than leave Sicily, they seized the city of Messana. Naming themselves [[Mamertines]] (or &quot;sons of Mars&quot;), they became a law unto themselves, terrorizing the surrounding countryside.

The Mamertines became a growing threat to Carthage and Syracuse alike. In [[265 BC]], [[Hiero II of Syracuse|Hiero II]], former general of Pyrrhus and the new tyrant of Syracuse, took action against them. Faced with a vastly superior force, the Mamertines divided into two factions, one advocating surrender to Carthage, the other preferring to seek aid from Rome. As a result, embassies were sent to both cities.

While the [[Roman Senate]] debated the best course of action, the Carthaginians eagerly agreed to send a garrison to Messana. A Carthaginian garrison was admitted to the city, and a Carthaginian fleet sailed into the Messanan harbor. However, soon afterwards they began negotiating with Hiero. Alarmed, the Mamertines sent another embassy to Rome asking them to expel the Carthaginians.

Hiero's intervention had placed Carthage's military forces directly across the narrow channel of water that separated Sicily from Italy. Moreover, the presence of the Carthaginian fleet gave them effective control over this channel, the [[Strait of Messina]], and demonstrated a clear and present danger to nearby Rome and her interests. The Roman senate was unable to decide on a course of action and referred the matter to the people, who voted to intervene.

The Roman attack on the Carthaginian forces at Messana triggered the first of the [[Punic Wars]]. Over the course of the next century, these three major conflicts between Rome and Carthage would determine the course of Western civilization. The wars included a Carthaginian invasion led by [[Hannibal Barca|Hannibal]], which nearly prevented the rise of the Roman Empire. Eventual victory by Rome was a turning point which meant that the civilization of the ancient Mediterranean would pass to the modern world via Southern Europe instead of North Africa.

Shortly after the First Punic War, Carthage faced a major [[Mercenary War|mercenary revolt]] which changed the internal political landscape of Carthage (bringing the [[Barcid]] family to prominence), and affected Carthage's international standing, as Rome used the events of the war to base a claim by which it seized [[Sardinia]] and [[Corsica]].

==The fall of Carthage==
The fall of Carthage was at the end of the third Punic War in [[146 BC]]. In spite of the initial devastating Roman naval losses at the beginning of the series of conflicts and Rome's recovery from the brink of defeat after the terror of a 15-year occupation of much of Italy by Hannibal, the end of the series of wars resulted in the end of Carthaginian power and the complete destruction of the city by [[Scipio Aemilianus]]. The Romans pulled the Phoenician warships out into the harbor and burned them before the city, and went from house to house, slaughtering and enslaving the people. The city was set ablaze, and in this way was razed with only ruins and rubble to field the aftermath.

==Roman Carthage==
Since the 19th century, some historians have written that the city of Carthage was [[salting the earth|salted]] to ensure that no crops could be grown there, but there is no ancient evidence for this.&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, R.T., &quot;To Be Taken with a Pinch of Salt: The Destruction of Carthage&quot;, ''Classical Philology'' vol. 81, no. 2  (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Follis-Domitius Alexander-carthage RIC 68.jpg|thumb|[[Domitius Alexander]] on a [[follis]]. On the reverse, the personification of Carthage, his capital.]]

When Carthage fell, its nearby rival [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]], a Roman ally, was made capital of the region and replaced Carthage as the leading center of Punic trade and leadership. It had the advantageous position of being situated on the Lake of Tunis and the outlet of the [[Majardah River]], Tunisia's only river that flowed all year long. However, grain cultivation in the Tunisian mountains caused large amounts of [[silt]] to erode into the river. This silt was accumulated in the harbor until it was made useless, and Rome was forced to rebuild Carthage.

A new city of Carthage was built on the same land, and by the 1st century AD it had grown to the second largest city in the western half of the [[Roman empire]], with a peak population of 500,000. It was the center of the Roman province of [[Africa Province, Roman Empire|Africa]], which was a major &quot;breadbasket&quot; of the empire. Carthage briefly became the capital of an usurper, [[Domitius Alexander]], in [[308]]&amp;ndash;[[311]] [[Anno Domini|AD]].

Carthage also became a center of early [[Christianity]]. [[Tertullian]] rhetorically addressed the Roman governor with the fact that the Christians of Carthage that just yesterday were few in number, now &quot;have filled every place among you ?cities, islands, fortresses, towns, market-places, the very camp, tribes, companies, palaces, senate, forum; we have left nothing to you but the temples of your gods.&quot; (''[[Apologeticus]]'' written at Carthage, c. [[197]]). It is worth noting that Tertullian omits any mention of the surrounding countryside or its network of villas not unlike colonial [[hacienda]] society.

[[Image:Roman-Villas-Carthage.jpg|thumb|Roman villas, Carthage]]

In the first of a string of rather poorly reported Councils at Carthage a few years later, no fewer than 70 bishops attended. Tertullian later broke with the mainstream that was represented more and more by the bishop of Rome, but a more serious rift among Christians was the [[Donatist]] controversy, which [[Augustine of Hippo]] spent much time and parchment arguing against. In [[397]] at the [[Council at Carthage]], the [[Biblical canon]] for the western Church was confirmed.

[[Image:Ruines de Carthage.jpg|thumb|Antonine baths ruins, from the Roman period]]

The political fallout from the deep disaffection of African Christians is supposedly a crucial factor in the ease with which Carthage and the other centers were captured in the 5th century by [[Gaiseric]], king of the [[Vandals]], who defeated the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[general]] [[Bonifacius]] and made the city his capital. Gaiseric was considered a heretic too, an [[Arianism|Arian]], and though Arians commonly despised Catholic Christians, a mere promise of toleration might have caused the city's population to accept him. After a failed attempt to recapture the city in the 5th century, the Byzantines finally subdued the Vandals in the 6th century. Using Gaiseric's grandson's deposal by a distant cousin, [[Gelimer]], as a pretext, the Byzantines dispatched an army to conquer the Vandal kingdom. On Sunday, October 15, 533, the Byzantine general [[Belisarius]], accompanied by his wife [[Antonina]], made his formal entry into Carthage, sparing it a sack and a [[Wiktionary:massacre|massacre]].

During the emperor [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice's]] reign, Carthage was made into an [[Exarchate]], as was [[Ravenna]] in Italy. These two exarchates were the western bulwarks of Byzantium, all that remained of its power in the west. In the early 7th century, it was the Exarch of Carthage [[Heraclius]], who overthrew Emperor [[Phocas]].

The Byzantine Exarchate was not, however, able to withstand the [[Arab]] conquerors of the 7th century. The first Arab assault on the Exarchate of Carthage was initiated from [[Egypt]] without much success in [[647]]. A more protracted campaign lasted from [[670]] to [[683]]. In [[698]], the [[Exarchate of Africa]] was finally overrun by  [[Hassan Ibn al Numan]] and a force of 40,000 men, who destroyed Roman Carthage, just as the Romans had done in [[146 BC]]. Carthage was replaced by [[Tunis]] as the major regional center. The destruction of the Exarchate of Africa marked a permanent end to Roman or Byzantine influence there, as the rising tide of Islam shattered the empire.

It is currently a suburb of [[Tunis]], [[Tunisia]], with a population of 20,715 (2004 Census).

The first civilization that developed within the city's sphere of influence is referred to as Punic (a form of the word &quot;Phoenician&quot;) or Carthaginian. The city of Carthage is located on the eastern side of [[Lake Tunis]] across from the centre of Tunis. According to Greek historians it was founded by [[Phoenicia]]n colonists from Tyre under the leadership of Elissa who was renamed ([[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Queen Dido]]) in Virgil's [[Aeneid]]. It became a large and rich city and thus a major power in the Mediterranean. The resulting rivalry with [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], [[Numidia]], and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] was accompanied by several wars with respective invasions of each other's homeland.

[[Hannibal]]'s invasion of Italy in the [[Second Punic War]] culminated in the Carthaginian [[battle of Cannae|victory at Cannae]] and led to a serious threat to the continuation of Roman rule over Italy; however, Carthage emerged from the conflict weaker after Hannibal's defeat at the [[Battle of Zama]] in 202&amp;nbsp;BC. After the [[Third Punic War]], the city was destroyed by the Romans in 146&amp;nbsp;BC. However, the Romans refounded Carthage, which became the Empire's fourth most important city and the capital of the short-lived [[Vandals#The Vandal Kingdom in North Africa|Vandal kingdom]]. It remained one of the most important Roman cities until the [[Umayyad conquest of North Africa|Muslim conquest]] when it was destroyed a second time in AD&amp;nbsp;698.

==Topography==
Carthage was built on a [[promontory]] with inlets to the sea to the north and south. The city's location made it master of the Mediterranean's maritime trade. All ships crossing the sea had to pass between [[Sicily]] and the coast of Tunisia, where Carthage was built, affording it great power and influence.

[[File:Carthage, Tunisia EO-1.jpg|[[Earth Observing-1|EO-1]] |right|thumb|260px]]
Two large, artificial harbours were built within the city, one for harbouring the city's massive navy of 220 warships and the other for mercantile trade. A walled tower overlooked both harbours.

The city had massive walls, 23 miles (37 kilometres) in length, longer than the walls of comparable cities. Most of the walls were located on the shore and thus could be less impressive, as Carthaginian control of the sea made attack from that direction difficult. The 2.5 to 3 miles (4 to 4.8 kilometres) of wall on the [[isthmus]] to the west were truly large and, in fact, were never penetrated.

The city had a huge [[necropolis]] or burial ground, religious area, market places, council house, towers and a theatre and was divided into four equally sized residential areas with the same layout. Roughly in the middle of the city stood a high citadel called the Byrsa.

Carthage was one of the largest cities in [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] times (by some estimates only [[Alexandria]] was larger){{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} and was among the largest cities in pre-industrial history.

The historical study of Carthage is problematic. Because its culture and records were destroyed by the Romans at the end of the [[Third Punic War]], very few Carthaginian [[primary source|primary historical sources]] survive.

===Foundation legends===
====Queen Elissa (Dido)====
[[File:Ruines de Carthage.jpg|thumb|Carthage]]
According to Roman sources, [[Phoenicia]]n colonists from modern-day [[Lebanon]], led by Queen Dido (Elissa) founded Carthage. [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Queen Elissa]] (also known as &quot;Alissar&quot;), was an exiled princess of the ancient Phoenician city of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]]. At its peak,  the metropolis she founded, Carthage, came to be called the &quot;shining city,&quot; ruling 300 other cities around the western Mediterranean and leading the Phoenician (or Punic) world.

Elissa's brother, King [[Pygmalion of Tyre]], had murdered her husband, the high priest. Elissa escaped the tyranny of her own country, founding the &quot;new city&quot; of Carthage and subsequently its later dominions. Details of her life are sketchy and confusing, but the following can be deduced from various sources. According to Justin, Princess Elissa was the daughter of King Matten of Tyre (also known as Muttoial or Belus II). When he died, the throne was jointly bequeathed to her and her brother, Pygmalion. She married her uncle Acherbas (also known as Sychaeus), the High Priest of [[Melqart]], a man with both authority and wealth comparable to the king. This led to increased rivalry between [[religion and politics|religion and the monarchy]]. Pygmalion was a tyrant, lover of both gold and intrigue, who desired the authority and fortune enjoyed by Acherbas.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Pygmalion assassinated Acherbas in the temple and kept the misdeed concealed from his sister for a long time, deceiving her with lies about her husband's death. At the same time, the people of Tyre called for a single sovereign, causing dissent within the royal family.

====The mention of Queen Elissa (Dido) in Virgil's Aeneid====
In the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] epic of [[Virgil]], the ''[[Aeneid]]'', [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Queen Dido]], the Greek name for Queen Elissa, is first introduced as an extremely respected character. In just seven years, since their exodus from [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], the Carthaginians have rebuilt a successful kingdom under her rule. Her subjects adore her and present her with a festival of praise. Her character is perceived by Virgil as even more noble when she offers asylum to [[Aeneas]] and his men, who have recently escaped from [[Troy]]. A spirit in the form of the messenger god, [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], sent by [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], reminds Aeneas that his mission is not to stay in Carthage with his new-found love, Dido, but to sail to Italy to found Rome. Virgil ends his legend of Dido with the story that, when Aeneas tells Dido, her heart broken, she orders a [[pyre]] to be built where she falls upon Aeneas' sword. As she lay dying, she predicted eternal strife between Aeneas' people and her own: &quot;rise up from my bones, avenging spirit&quot; (4.625, trans. Fitzgerald) she says, an invocation of [[Hannibal]]. The details of Virgil's story do not, however form part of the original legend and are significant mainly as an indication of Rome's attitude towards the city she had destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Carthage and the Carthaginians, R Bosworth Smithp16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carthaginian Republic===
{{Main|Carthaginian Republic}}
[[File:CarthageMap.png|thumb|Carthaginian held territory in the early 3rd century BC]]
The Carthaginian Republic was one of the longest-lived and largest states in the ancient Mediterranean. Reports relay several wars with [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]] and finally, Rome, which eventually resulted in the defeat and destruction of Carthage in the third Punic war.

====Army====
{{Main|Military of ancient Carthage}}
According to Polybius, Carthage relied heavily, though not exclusively, on foreign mercenaries,&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, Book 6, 52. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0234&amp;query=head%3D%23524 On the ''Perseus'' project] &lt;blockquote&gt;
The former (the Romans - editor's note) bestow their whole attention upon this department (upon military service on land - editor's note): whereas the Carthaginians wholly neglect their infantry, though they do take some slight interest in the cavalry. The reason of this is that they employ foreign mercenaries, the Romans native and citizen levies. It is in this point that the latter polity is preferable to the former. They have their hopes of freedom ever resting on the courage of mercenary troops: the Romans on the valour of their own citizens and the aid of their allies.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; especially in overseas warfare. The core of its army was from its own territory in north Africa (ethnic [[Libyans]] and [[Numidians]], as well as &quot;Liby-Phoenicians&quot; ? i.e. Phoenicians proper). These troops were supported by mercenaries from different ethnic groups and geographic locations across the Mediterranean who fought in their own national units; [[Celt]]ic, [[Balearic Islands|Balearic]], and [[Iberians|Iberian]] troops were especially common. Later, after the Barcid conquest of Iberia, Iberians came to form an even greater part of the Carthaginian forces. Carthage seems to have fielded a formidable cavalry force, especially in its north African homeland; a significant part of it was composed of Numidian contingents of [[Numidian cavalry|light cavalry]]. Other mounted troops included the now extinct [[North African elephant]]s, trained for war, which, among other uses, were commonly used for frontal assaults or as anti-cavalry protection. An army could field up to several hundred of these animals, but on most reported occasions fewer than a hundred were deployed. The riders of these elephants were armed with a spike and hammer to kill the elephants in case they charged toward their own army.

====Navy====
[[File:Romtrireme.jpg|thumb|Roman [[trireme]] mosaic from Carthage, [[Bardo Museum]], Tunis ]]
The navy of Carthage was one of the largest in the [[Mediterranean]], using [[serial production]] to maintain high numbers at moderate cost. The sailors and [[marine (military)|marines]] of the Carthaginian navy were predominantly recruited from the [[Punic]] citizenry, unlike the multi-ethnic allied and [[mercenary]] troops of the Carthaginian armies. The navy offered a stable profession and financial security for its sailors. This helped to contribute to the city's political stability, since the unemployed, debt ridden poor in other cities were frequently inclined to support revolutionary leaders in the hope of improving their own lot.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Goldsworthy - The Fall of Carthage&lt;/ref&gt; The reputation of her skilled sailors implies that there was in peacetime a training of oarsmen and coxswains, giving their navy a cutting edge in naval matters.

The trade of Carthaginian merchantmen was by land across the Sahara and especially by sea throughout the Mediterranean and far into the Atlantic to the tin-rich islands of Britain and to West Africa. There is evidence that at least one Punic expedition under [[Hanno the Navigator|Hanno]] sailed along the West African coast to regions south of the [[Tropic of Cancer]], describing how the sun was in the north at noon.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

[[Polybius]] wrote in the sixth book of his History that the Carthaginians were &quot;more exercised in maritime affairs than any other people.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, History Book 6&lt;/ref&gt; Their navy included some 300 to 350 warships. The Romans, who had little experience in naval warfare prior to the [[First Punic War]], managed to finally defeat Carthage with a combination of reverse engineering captured Carthaginian ships, recruitment of experienced [[Greeks|Greek]] sailors from the ranks of its conquered cities, the unorthodox [[Corvus (weapon)|corvus]] device, and their superior numbers in marines and rowers. In the [[Third Punic War]] Polybius describes a tactical innovation of the Carthaginians, augmenting their few triremes with small vessels that carried hooks (to attack the oars) and fire (to attack the hulls). With this new combination, they were able to stand their ground against the superior Roman numbers for a whole day.

====Fall====
[[File:Tunisie Carthage Ruines 08.JPG|right|thumb|Ruins of Carthage]]
The fall of Carthage came at the end of the [[Third Punic War]] in 146 BC at the [[Battle of Carthage (c.149 BC)|Battle of Carthage]].&lt;ref&gt;''Wine: The 8,000-Year-Old Story of the Wine Trade'', Thomas Pellechia (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Despite initial devastating Roman naval losses and Rome's recovery from the brink of defeat after the terror of a 15-year occupation of much of Italy by [[Hannibal]], the end of the series of wars resulted in the end of Carthaginian power and the complete destruction of the city by [[Scipio Aemilianus]]. The Romans pulled the Phoenician warships out into the harbor and burned them before the city, and went from house to house, capturing, raping and enslaving the people. Fifty thousand Carthaginians were sold into [[slavery in ancient Rome|slavery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0001198.html Ancient History]&lt;/ref&gt; The city was set ablaze, and razed to the ground, leaving only ruins and rubble. After the fall of Carthage, Rome annexed the majority of the Carthaginian colonies, including other North African locations such as [[Volubilis]], [[Lixus (ancient city)|Lixus]], [[Chellah]], and [[Mogador]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=14906 C. Michael Hogan (2007) ''Volubilis'', The Megalithic Portal, ed. by A. Burnham]&lt;/ref&gt; The legend that the city was [[Salting the earth|sown with salt]] is not mentioned by the ancient sources; R.T. Ridley suggested that the story originated from 1930 in section of the Cambridge Ancient History written by B Hallward whose influence might be an account of [[Abimelech]]'s salting of [[Shechem]] in [[Book of Judges|Judges]] 9:45.&lt;ref&gt;R.T. Ridley, &quot;To Be Taken with a Pinch of Salt: The Destruction of Carthage&quot;, ''Classical Philology'' '''81''':2 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Ripley, Charles Anderson Dana, ''The New American Cyclop?dia: a Popular Dictionary of General Knowledge'' '''4''':497, 1863 [http://books.google.com/books?id=bK4rAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA497&amp;dq=carthage+sowing+salt&amp;q=carthage+sowing+salt#v=onepage full text]&lt;/ref&gt;  Warmington admitted his fault in repeating Hallward's error but mentions an example of the story that goes back to 1299 when [[Pope Boniface VIII|Bonaface VIII]] destroyed [[Palestrina]].&lt;ref&gt;B. H. Warmington &quot;The Destruction of Carthage, A Retratatio&quot;, ''Classical Philology'' '''83''':4 (1988). pp308-10&lt;/ref&gt;

===A city of survivors===
====Byrsa====

{{Main|Byrsa}}

[[File:Maison punique byrsa.jpg|thumb|right|District of Punic Byrsa]]

On top of [[Byrsa]] hill, the location of the [[Forum (Roman)|Roman Forum]], a residential area from the last century of existence (early 2nd century) of the Punic city was excavated by the French archaeologist Serge Lancel. The neighborhood, with its houses, shops and private spaces, is significant for what it reveals about daily life there over twenty-one hundred years ago. .&lt;ref&gt;Serge Lancel and Jean-Paul Morel, &quot;Byrsa. Punic vestiges&quot;; ''To save Carthage. Exploration and conservation of the city Punic, Roman and Byzantine'', Unesco / INAA, 1992, pp. 43-59&lt;/ref&gt;

The habitat is typical, even stereotypical.  The street was often used as a storefront; cistern tanks were installed in basements to collect water for domestic use, and a long corridor on the right side of each residence led to a courtyard containing a [[sump]], around which various other elements may be found. In some places the ground is covered with mosaics called punica pavement, sometimes using a characteristic red mortar.

The remains have been preserved under embankments, the [[substructures]] of the later [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] forum, whose foundation piles dot the district. The housing blocks are separated by a grid of straight streets approximately six metres wide, with a roadway consisting of clay; there are ''in situ'' stairs to compensate for the slope of the hill. Construction of this type presupposes organization and political will, and has inspired the name of the neighborhood, &quot;Hannibal district&quot;, referring to the Punic general or [[Suffete]]  at the beginning of the 2nd century BC.

===Roman Carthage===

[[File:Karta Karthago.PNG|thumb|Roman Carthage]]
When Carthage fell, its nearby rival [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]], a Roman ally, was made capital of the region and replaced Carthage as the leading center of Punic trade and leadership. It had the advantageous position of being situated on the Lake of Tunis and the outlet of the [[Majardah River]], Tunisia's only river that flowed all year long. However, grain cultivation in the Tunisian mountains caused large amounts of [[silt]] to erode into the river. This silt was accumulated in the harbor until it was made useless, and Rome was forced to rebuild Carthage.

By 122 BC, [[Gaius Gracchus]] founded a short-lived [[Colonia (Roman)|''colonia'']], called [[Colonia Junonia|''Colonia Iunonia'']], after the Latin name for the punic goddess [[Tanit]], ''Iuno caelestis''. The purpose was to obtain arable lands for impoverished farmers. The [[Roman Senate|Senate]] abolished the colony some time later, in order to undermine Gracchus' power.

After this ill-fated attempt, a new city of Carthage was built on the same land by [[Julius Caesar]] in 49-44 BC period, and by the 1st century it had grown to be the second largest city in the western half of the [[Roman Empire]], with a peak population of 500,000{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}. It was the center of the Roman province of [[Africa Province, Roman Empire|Africa]], which was a major breadbasket of the Empire.

Carthage also became a [[Early centers of Christianity#Carthage|centre of early Christianity]]. In the first of a string of rather poorly reported Councils at Carthage a few years later, no fewer than seventy bishops attended. [[Tertullian]] later broke with the mainstream that was represented more and more by the [[Early centers of Christianity#Rome|bishop of Rome]], but a more serious rift among Christians was the [[Donatist]] controversy, which [[Augustine of Hippo]] spent much time and parchment arguing against. In 397 at the [[Council at Carthage]], the [[Development of the Christian biblical canon|biblical canon for the western Church was confirmed]].

[[File:NE 500ad.jpg|thumb|Vandal Empire in 500 AD, centered in Carthage.]]

The political fallout from the deep disaffection of African Christians is supposedly a crucial factor in the ease with which Carthage and the other centres were captured in the 5th century by [[Gaiseric]], king of the [[Vandals]], who defeated the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[general]] [[Bonifacius]] and made the city his capital. Gaiseric was considered a heretic too, an [[Arianism|Arian]], and though Arians commonly despised Catholic Christians, a mere promise of toleration might have caused the city's population to accept him. After a failed attempt to recapture the city in the 5th century, the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] finally [[Vandalic War|subdued the Vandals]] in 533-534.

Thereafter the city became the seat of the [[praetorian prefecture of Africa]], which during the Emperor [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice's]] reign, was made into an [[Exarchate]], as was [[Ravenna]] in [[Italy]]. These two exarchates were the western bulwarks of Byzantium, all that remained of its power in the west. In the early 7th century, it was the Exarch of Carthage, who overthrew Emperor [[Phocas]].

===Islamic Carthage===

The [[Exarchate of Africa]] was not able to withstand the [[Muslim conquests|Muslim]] conquerors of the 7th century. [[Umayyad]] Caliph [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] in 686 AD sent a force led by Zuhayr ibn Qais who won a battle over Byzantines and [[Berber people|Berbers]] led by [[Kusaila]], on the [[Qairawan]] plain, but could not follow that up. In 695 AD [[Hasan ibn al-Nu'man]] captured Carthage and advanced into the [[Atlas Mountains]]. A [[Byzantine]] fleet arrived and retook Carthage, but in 698 AD [[Hasan ibn al-Nu'man]] returned and defeated [[Tiberios III]] at the [[Battle of Carthage (698)|Battle of Carthage]]. The Byzantines withdrew from all of Africa except [[Ceuta]]. Roman Carthage was destroyed, just as the Romans had destroyed the Carthaginian Republic in 146 BC. Carthage was replaced by [[Tunis]] as the major regional centre. The destruction of the Exarchate of Africa marked a permanent end to Roman/Byzantine influence there.

==Modern times==
Carthage remains a popular [[tourist]] attraction and residential [[suburb]] of [[Tunis]]. The Tunisian presidential palace is located in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=648961&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=200|agency=philSTAR.com|title=More Tunisia unrest: Presidential palace gunbattle |date=17 January 2011|accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1985,  [[Ugo Vetere]], the mayor of [[Rome]], and Chedly Klibi, the mayor of Carthage, signed a symbolic treaty &quot;officially&quot; ending the conflict between their cities, which had been supposedly [[List of wars extended by diplomatic irregularity|extended by the lack of a peace treaty]] for more than 2,100 years.&lt;ref&gt;
http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198503/delenda.est.carthago.htm written by John Lawton&lt;/ref&gt;

== Carthage in fiction ==
Carthage features in Gustave Flaubert's historical novel ''[[Salammb? (novel)|Salammb?]]'' (1862). Set around the time of the Mercenaries' War, it includes a dramatic description of child sacrifice, and the boy Hannibal narrowly avoiding being sacrificed.

In ''[[The Dead Past]]'', a science fiction short story by [[Isaac Asimov]], a leading character is an ancient historian who is trying to disprove the allegation that the Carthaginians carried out child sacrifice.

In [[Kushiel's Mercy]] by [[Jacqueline Carey]], Carthage is a conquering nation that is geographically and culturally based on the historical Carthage.

''The Purple Quest'' by [[Frank G. Slaughter]] is about the founding of Carthage.

The TV Series ''[[Spartacus: Blood and Sand]]'' and  ''[[Spartacus: Gods of the Arena]]'', which are set in ancient Rome, feature a gladiator named Barca who is also known as &quot;The Beast of Carthage&quot; and was present at its fall.

Temple of Antas

<text>
[[File:Tempio di Antas.jpg|thumb|220px|The Temple of Antas.]]The '''Temple of Antas''' is an ancient [[Carthaginian]]-[[Roman architecture|Roman]] temple in the commune of [[Fluminimaggiore]], southern [[Sardinia]], [[Italy]]. It is located in an area colonized by the Carthaginians and then by the Romans, attracted by its  iron and lead deposits.
It consists of a Roman temple, under whose steps are the remains of the Carthaginian one, which was dedicated to the god ''Sid Addir'', a later incarnation of the local god ''[[Sardus|Sardus Pater Babai]]'', the main male divinity of the [[Nuragic civilization]].

The original temple had been built around 500 BC over a sacred limestone [[outcrop]], and restored around 300 BC. The Roman temple was built by emperor [[Augustus]] (27 BC - 14 AD) and restored under [[Caracalla]] (213-217 AD). Its remains were discovered in 1836 by general [[Alberto La Marmora]], and rebuilt to the current status in 1967.

The fore section of the temple includes six columns, with a height of some 8 meters, with [[Ionic columns|Ionic capitals]]. Originally a triangular [[pediment]] was also present. The [[cella]] was accessed through two side openings and had a mosaic-covered pavement, part of which has been preserved. The temple was provided with two square reservoirs, which housed the water for the sacred rites of purification.

It is likely that a statue of the Sardus Pater was housed in the cella. According to the size of the only remain found, a finger, it has been estimated that it was some 3 meters high.

The archaeological area of temple includes a small [[necropolis]], remains of an ancient Nuragic village (13th-10th centuries BC), Roman quarries of limestone and an ancient path connecting the temple to a sacred cave where the water cult was practiced.

Tertullian

<text>
[[File:Tertullian.jpg|thumb|A woodcut illustration depicting Tertullian]]'''Quintus Septimius Florens Tertullianus''', [[anglicised]] as '''Tertullian''' (c. 160 ? c. 225 AD),&lt;ref&gt;T.D.Barnes, ''Tertullian: a literary and historical study'Oxford, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; was a prolific early Christian author from [[Carthage]] in the Roman province of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;T. D. Barnes, ''Tertullian: a Historical and Literary Study'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1985), 58.&lt;/ref&gt; He is the first Christian author to produce an extensive corpus of [[Latin]] Christian literature. He also was a notable early [[Christian apologetics|Christian apologist]] and a polemicist against [[heresy]]. Tertullian has been called &quot;the father of [[Latin Christianity]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ekonomou&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;the founder of Western theology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gonzales&quot;&gt;Justo L. Gonz?les, ''The Story of Christianity, Volume 1: The Early Church to the Dawn of the Reformation'' (New York: HarperCollins Publishers, 2010), 91-93.&lt;/ref&gt;
Though conservative, he did originate and advance new theology to the early Church. He is perhaps most famous for being the oldest extant Latin writer to use the term '''Trinity''' (Latin '''trinitas'''),&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Trinitas&quot; is itself a Latinization of the Greek &quot;he trias&quot; (the Triad), a term that was used earlier than Tertullian by [[Theophilus of Antioch]] in ''Ad Autolycum'' 2.15 to refer to God, God's Logos (Jesus), and God's Sophia (Holy Spirit)&lt;/ref&gt; and giving the oldest extant formal exposition of a Trinitarian theology.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Adversus Praxean''; see Barnes for a summary of the work.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Latin formulations that first appear in his work are &quot;three Persons, one Substance&quot; as the Latin &quot;tres [[Persona]]e, [[Consubstantial|una Substantia]]&quot; (itself from the [[Koine Greek]] &quot;treis [[Hypostasis (religion)|Hypostases]], [[Ousios|Homoousios]]&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;gonzales&quot; /&gt; He wrote his trinitarian formula after becoming a [[Montanist]]; his ideas were at first rejected as heresy by the church at large, but later accepted as Christian orthodoxy.&lt;ref name=&quot;gonzales&quot; /&gt;

== Life ==
Scant reliable evidence exists to inform us about Tertullian's life. Most history about him comes from passing references in his own writings.

According to church tradition, he was raised in [[Carthage]]&lt;ref name =&quot;Oxford&quot;&gt;Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and was thought to be the son of a Roman centurion, a trained lawyer, and an ordained priest. These assertions rely on the accounts of [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Church History]]'', II, ii. 4, and [[Jerome]]'s ''[[De Viris Illustribus (Jerome)|De viris illustribus]]'' (On famous men) chapter 53.&lt;ref&gt;See introduction to [[Timothy Barnes]], 'Tertullian: A Historical and Literary Study; however Barnes retracted some of his positions in the 1985 revised edition&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jerome]] claimed that Tertullian's father held the position of 'centurio proconsularis' (&quot;aide-de-camp&quot;) in the [[Roman army]] in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerome]], 'Chronicon' 16.23-4&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is unclear whether any such position in the Roman military ever existed.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Timothy. 'Tertullian: A Historical and Literary Study', Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1971, pg. 11 [http://books.google.com/books?id=eH-BNqfc8iMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Tertullian:+A+Historical+and+Literary+Study&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hl=it#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20title%20centurio%20proconsularis&amp;f=true Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, Tertullian has been thought to be a lawyer based on his use of legal analogies and an identification of him with the jurist Tertullianus, who is quoted in the ''[[Pandects]]''. Although Tertullian utilized a knowledge of Roman law in his writings, his legal knowledge does not demonstrably exceed that of what could be expected from a sufficient Roman education.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, pg. 24,27&lt;/ref&gt; The writings of Tertullianus, a lawyer of the same [[cognomen]], exist only in fragments and do not denote a Christian authorship. (Tertullianus was mis-identified only much later with the Christian Tertullian by church historians.)&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, pg. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, any notion of Tertullian being a priest is also questionable. In his extant writings, he never describes himself as ordained&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, pg. 11&lt;/ref&gt; in the church and seems to place himself among the laity.&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, De Exhortatione Castitatis 7.3 and De Monogamia 12.2&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman Africa was famous as the home of orators. This influence can be seen in his style with its archaisms or provincialisms, its glowing imagery and its passionate temper. He was a scholar with an excellent education. He wrote at least three books in Greek. In them he refers to himself, but none of these are extant. His principal study was jurisprudence and his methods of reasoning reveal striking marks of his juridical training. He shone among the advocates of Rome, as Eusebius reports.

His conversion to Christianity perhaps took place about 197?198 (cf. [[Adolf Harnack]], [[Bonwetsch]], and others), but its immediate antecedents are unknown except as they are conjectured from his writings. The event must have been sudden and decisive, transforming at once his own personality. He said of himself that he could not imagine a truly Christian life without such a conscious breach, a radical act of conversion: &quot;Christians are made, not born&quot; (''Apol'', xviii).

Two books addressed to his wife confirm that he was married to a Christian wife.

In middle life (about 207), he was attracted to the &quot;New Prophecy&quot; of [[Montanism]], and seems to have split from the mainstream church. In the time of Augustine, a group of &quot;Tertullianists&quot; still had a basilica in Carthage which, within that same period, passed to the orthodox Church. It is unclear whether the name was merely another for the Montanists&lt;ref&gt;The passage in ''Praedestinatus'' describing the Tertullianists suggests that this might have been the case, as the Tertullianist minister obtains the use of a church in Rome on the grounds that the martyrs to whom it was dedicated were Montanists. But the passage is very condensed and ambiguous.&lt;/ref&gt; or that this means Tertullian later split with the Montanists and founded his own group.

Jerome&lt;ref&gt;''De viris illustribus'' 53&lt;/ref&gt; says that Tertullian lived to a great age, but there is no reliable source attesting to his survival beyond the estimated year 225 AD. In spite of his schism from the Church, he continued to write against heresy, especially [[Gnosticism]]. Thus, by the doctrinal works he published, Tertullian became the teacher of [[Cyprian]] and the predecessor of [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], who, in turn, became the chief founder of Latin theology.

== Writings ==
=== General character ===
Thirty-one works are extant, together with fragments of more. Some fifteen works in Latin or Greek are lost, some as recently as the 9th century (''De Paradiso, De superstitione saeculi, De carne et anima'' were all extant in the now damaged [[Codex Agobardinus]] in 814 AD). Tertullian's writings cover the whole theological field of the time ? apologetics against paganism and Judaism, polemics, polity, discipline, and morals, or the whole reorganization of human life on a Christian basis; they gave a picture of the religious life and thought of the time which is of the greatest interest to the church historian.

=== Chronology and contents ===
The chronology of these writings is difficult to fix with certainty. It is in part determined by the [[Montanism|Montanistic]] views that are set forth in some of them, by the author's own allusions to ''this'' writing, or ''that,'' as antedating others (cf. Harnack, ''Litteratur'' ii.260?262), and by definite historic data (e.g., the reference to the death of [[Septimius Severus]], ''Ad Scapulam'', iv). In his work against [[Marcion]], which he calls his third composition on the Marcionite heresy, he gives its date as the fifteenth year of the reign of Severus (''Adv. Marcionem'', i.1, 15) --which would be approximately the year 208.

The writings may be divided with reference to the two periods of Tertullian's Christian activity, the Catholic and the Montanist (cf. Harnack, ii.262 sqq.), or according to their subject-matter. The object of the former mode of division is to show, if possible, the change of views Tertullian's mind underwent. Following the latter mode, which is of a more practical interest, the writings fall into two groups. Apologetic and polemic writings, like ''[[Apologeticus]]'', ''De testimonio animae'', ''Adv. Judaeos'', ''Adv. Marcionem'', ''Adv. Praxeam'', ''Adv. Hermogenem'', ''De praescriptione hereticorum'', and ''Scorpiace'' were written to counteract [[Gnosticism]] and other religious or philosophical doctrines. The other group consists of practical and disciplinary writings, e.g., ''De monogamia'', ''Ad uxorem'', ''De virginibus velandis'', ''De cultu feminarum'', ''De patientia'', ''De pudicitia'', ''De oratione'', and ''Ad martyras''.

Among his apologetic writings, the ''Apologeticus,'' addressed to the Roman magistrates, is a most pungent defense of Christianity and the Christians against the reproaches of the pagans, and an important legacy of the ancient Church, proclaiming the principle of [[freedom of religion]] as an inalienable human right and demands a fair trial for Christians before they are condemned to death.

Tertullian was the first to break the force of such charges as that the Christians sacrificed infants at the celebration of the Lord's Supper and committed incest. He pointed to the commission of such crimes in the pagan world and then proved by the testimony of [[Pliny the Younger|Pliny]] that Christians pledged themselves not to commit murder, adultery, or other crimes. He adduced also the inhumanity of pagan customs such as feeding the flesh of gladiators to beasts. He argued that the gods have no existence and thus there is no pagan religion against which Christians may offend. Christians do not engage in the foolish worship of the emperors. They do better: they pray for them. Christians can afford to be put to torture and to death, and the more they are cast down the more they grow; &quot;the blood of the [[martyr]]s is seed&quot; (''Apologeticum'', 50). In the ''De Praescriptione'' he develops as its fundamental idea that, in a dispute between the Church and a separating party, the whole [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] lies with the latter, as the Church, in possession of the unbroken tradition, is by its very existence a guarantee of its truth.

The five books against Marcion, written 207 or 208, are the most comprehensive and elaborate of his polemical works, invaluable for gauging the early Christian view of Gnosticism. Of the moral and ascetic treatises, the ''De patientia'' and ''[[De spectaculis]]'' are among the most interesting, and the ''De pudicitia'' and ''De virginibus velandis'' among the most characteristic.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

== Theology ==
=== General character ===
Though thoroughly conversant with the Greek theology, Tertullian was independent of its metaphysical speculation. He had learned from the Greek apologies, and forms a direct contrast to [[Origen of Alexandria]], who drew much of his theories regarding creation from middle platonism. Tertullian, the prince of realists and practical theologian, carried his [[philosophical realism|realism]] to the verge of materialism. This is evident from his ascription to God of corporeity and his acceptance of the traducian theory of the origin of the soul. He despised Greek philosophy, and, far from looking at [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and other Greek thinkers whom he quotes as forerunners of Christ and the Gospel, he pronounces them the patriarchal forefathers of the heretics (''De anima'', iii.). He held up to scorn their inconsistency when he referred to the fact that [[Socrates]] in dying ordered a cock to be sacrificed to [[Aesculapius]] (''De anima'', i). Tertullian always wrote under stress of a felt necessity. He was never so happy as when he had opponents like [[Marcion]] and [[Praxeas]], and, however abstract the ideas may be which he treated, he was always moved by practical considerations to make his case clear and irresistible. It was partly this element which gave to his writings a formative influence upon the theology of the post-Nicene period in the West and has rendered them fresh reading to this day. He was a born disputant. It is true that during the 3rd century no mention is made of his name by other authors. Lactantius at the opening of the 4th century is the first to do this, but Augustine treats him openly with respect. Cyprian, Tertullian's North African compatriot, though he nowhere mentions his name, was well read in his writings, as Cyprian's secretary told Jerome.

=== Specific teachings ===
Tertullian's main doctrinal teachings are as follows:
# The soul was not preexistent, as Plato affirmed, nor subject to [[metempsychosis]] or [[reincarnation]], as the [[Pythagoreans]] held. In each individual it is a new product, proceeding equally with the body from the parents, and not created later and associated with the body (''De anima'', xxvii). This position is called [[traducianism]] in opposition to '[[Creationism (soul)|creationism]]', or the idea that each soul is a fresh creation of God. For Tertullian the soul is, however, a distinct entity and a certain corporeity and as such it may be tormented in Hell (''De anima'', lviii).
# The soul's sinfulness is easily explained by its [[traducian]] origin (''De anima'', xxxix). It is in bondage to [[Satan]] (whose works it renounces in baptism), but has seeds of good (''De anima'', xli), and when awakened, it passes to health and at once calls upon God (''Apol.'', xvii.) and is naturally Christian. It exists in all men alike; it is a culprit and yet an unconscious witness by its impulse to worship, its fear of demons, and its musings on death to the power, benignity, and judgment of God as revealed in the Christian's Scriptures (''De testimonio,'' v-vi).
# God, who made the world out of nothing through his Son, the Word, has corporeity though he is a spirit (''De praescriptione'', vii.; ''Adv. Praxeam,'' vii.). However Tertullian used 'corporeal' only in the stoic sense, to mean something with actual existence, rather than the later idea of flesh. In the statement of the Trinity, Tertullian was a forerunner of the Nicene doctrine, approaching the subject from the standpoint of the Logos doctrine, though he did not state the immanent Trinity. His use of ''trinitas'' (Latin: 'Threeness') emphasised the manifold character of God. In his treatise against Praxeas, who taught [[patripassianism]] in Rome, he used the words, &quot; Trinity and economy, persons and substance.&quot; The Son is distinct from the Father, and the Spirit from both the Father and the Son (''Adv. Praxeam,'' xxv).  &quot;These three are one substance, not one person; and it is said, 'I and my Father are one' in respect not of the singularity of number but the unity of the substance.&quot; The very names &quot;Father&quot; and &quot;Son&quot; indicate the distinction of personality. The Father is one, the Son is one, and the Spirit is one (''Adv. Praxeam'', ix). As regards the question whether the Son was coeternal with the Father, many believe that Tertullian did not teach that. ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'' comments that for Tertullian, &quot;There was a time when there was no Son and no sin, when God was neither Father nor Judge.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14520c.htm &quot;Tertullian,&quot; ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Benjamin Breckinridge Warfield|B. B. Warfield]] in ''Princeton Theological Review'', 1906, pp. 56, 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly [[J.N.D. Kelly]] has stated: &quot;Tertullian followed the Apologists in dating His ?perfect generation? from His extrapolation for the work of creation; prior to that moment God could not strictly be said to have had a Son, while after it the term ?Father?, which for earlier theologians generally connoted God as author of reality, began to acquire the specialized meaning of Father and Son.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;J.N.D. Kelly, ''Early Christian Doctrines,'' Continual International Publishing Book, c1960, 2000, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; As regards the subjects of [[subordinationism|subordination]] of the Son to the Father, the ''New Catholic Encyclopedia'' has commented: &quot;In not a few areas of theology, Tertullian?s views are, of course, completely unacceptable. Thus, for example, his teaching on the Trinity reveals a subordination of Son to Father that in the later crass form of Arianism the Church rejected as heretical.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;W. Le Saint, &quot;Tertullian,&quot; ''The New Catholic Encyclopedia,'' Thompson Gale, 2003, Vol. 13, p. 837.&lt;/ref&gt;
# In [[soteriology]], Tertullian does not dogmatize; he prefers to keep silence at the mystery of the cross (''De Patientia'', iii). The sufferings of Christ's life as well as of the crucifixion are efficacious to redemption. In the water of [[baptism]], which (upon a partial quotation of John 3:5) is made necessary (''De baptismo'', vi.), humans are born again; the baptized does not receive the [[Holy Spirit]] in the water, but is prepared for the Holy Spirit. Humans are little fishes&amp;mdash;after the example of the ''[[ichthys]]'', fish, Jesus Christ&amp;mdash;are born in water (''De baptismo'', i). In discussing whether sins committed subsequent to baptism may be forgiven, Tertullian calls baptism and [[penance]] &quot;two planks&quot; on which the sinner may be saved from shipwreck ? language which he gave to the Church (''De penitentia'', xii).
# With reference to the 'rule of faith', it may be said that Tertullian is constantly using this expression, and by it means ''now'' the authoritative tradition handed down in the Church, ''now'' the Scriptures themselves, and, ''perhaps'', a definite doctrinal formula. While he nowhere gives a list of the books of Scripture, he divides them into two parts and calls them the ''instrumentum '' and ''testamentum'' (''Adv. Marcionem'', iv.1). He distinguishes between the four Gospels and insists upon their apostolic origin as accrediting their authority (''De praescriptione'', xxxvi; ''Adv. Marcionem'', iv.1?5); in trying to account for Marcion's treatment of the Lucan Gospel and the Pauline writings he sarcastically queries whether the &quot;shipmaster from Pontus&quot; (Marcion) had ever been guilty of taking on contraband goods or tampering with them after they were aboard (''Adv. Marcionem'', v.1). The Scripture, the rule of faith, is for him fixed and authoritative (''De corona'', iii-iv). As opposed to the pagan writings they are divine (''De testimonio animae'', vi). They contain all truth (''De praescriptione'', vii, xiv) and from them the Church drinks (''potat'') her faith (''Adv. Praxeam'', xiii). The prophets were older than the Greek philosophers and their authority is accredited by the fulfilment of their predictions (''Apol.'', xix-xx). The Scriptures and the teachings of philosophy are incompatible, insofar as the latter are the origins of sub-Christian heresies. &quot;What has [[Athens]] to do with [[Jerusalem]]?&quot; he exclaims, &quot;or the Academy with the Church?&quot;  (''De praescriptione'', vii). Philosophy as pop-paganism is a work of demons (''De anima'', i); the Scriptures contain the wisdom of heaven. However, Tertullian was not averse to using the technical methods of [[Stoicism]] to discuss a problem (''De anima''). The rule of faith, however, seems to be also applied by Tertullian to some distinct formula of doctrine, and he gives a succinct statement of the Christian faith under this term (''De praescriptione'', xiii).
#Tertullian was a defender of the necessity of apostolicity. In his ''Prescription Against Heretics'', he explicitly challenges heretics to produce evidence of the [[apostolic succession]] of their communities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0311.htm The Prescription against Heretics: Chapter 32&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Let them produce the original records of their churches; let them unfold the roll of their bishops, running down in due succession from the beginning in such a manner that [that first bishop of theirs] bishop shall be able to show for his ordainer and predecessor some one of the apostles or of apostolic men, ? a man, moreover, who continued steadfast with the apostles. For this is the manner in which the apostolic churches transmit their registers: as the church of Smyrna, which records that Polycarp was placed therein by John; as also the church of Rome, which makes Clement to have been ordained in like manner by Peter. In exactly the same way the other churches likewise exhibit (their several worthies), whom, as having been appointed to their episcopal places by apostles, they regard as transmitters of the apostolic seed.&quot;
# [[Fornication|Fornicators]] and [[Murder]]ers should never be admitted into the church under any circumstances. In ''de pudicitia'', Tertullian condemns Pope [[Callixtus I]] for allowing such people in when they show repentance.

== Moral principles ==
Tertullian was a determined advocate of strict discipline and an austere code of practise, and like many of the African fathers, one of the leading representatives of the rigorist element in the early Church. These views may have led him to adopt [[Montanism]] with its ascetic [[rigor]] and its belief in [[chiliasm]] and the continuance of the prophetic gifts. In his writings on public amusements, the veiling of virgins, the conduct of women, and the like, he gives expression to these views.

On the principle that we should not look at or listen to what we have no right to practise, and that polluted things, seen and touched, pollute (''De spectaculis'', viii, xvii), he declared a Christian should abstain from the theater and the amphitheater. There pagan religious rites were applied and the names of pagan divinities invoked; there the precepts of modesty, purity, and humanity were ignored or set aside, and there no place was offered to the onlookers for the cultivation of the Christian graces. Women should put aside their gold and precious stones as ornaments (''De cultu'', v-vi), and virgins should conform to the law of St. Paul for women and keep themselves strictly veiled (''De virginibus velandis''). He praised the unmarried state as the highest (''De monogamia'', xvii; ''Ad uxorem'', i.3), called upon Christians not to allow themselves to be excelled in the virtue of celibacy by Vestal Virgins and Egyptian priests, and he pronounced second marriage a species of adultery (''De exhortations castitatis'', ix).

Tertullian has been accused of going to an unhealthy extreme in his counsels of asceticism; for example, about [[ejaculation|ejaculatory]] [[orgasm]]s he wrote:
:''In that last breaking wave of delight, do we not feel something of our very soul go out from us?''&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, ''de anima'', 27:5&lt;/ref&gt;

His moral vigour and the service he provided as an ingenious and intrepid defender of the Christian religion were, for him, down to his view of Christianity as first and chiefly an experience of the heart.

Because of his later affiliation with Montanism, he, like the influential Alexandrian theologian, [[Origen of Alexandria|Origen]], has failed to receive the elevation of official [[canonization]].

Tertullian is sometimes criticized for being [[misogynistic]], on the basis of the contents of his 'De Cultu Feminarum,' section I.I, part 2 (trans. C.W. Marx): &quot;Do you not know that you are Eve? The judgment of God upon this sex lives on in this age; therefore, necessarily the guilt should live on also. You are the gateway of the devil; you are the one who unseals the curse of that tree, and you are the first one to turn your back on the divine law; you are the one who persuaded him whom the devil was not capable of corrupting; you easily destroyed the image of God, Adam. Because of what you deserve, that is, death, even the Son of God had to die.?

Tertullian wrote in his book ''On Patience'' 5:15 &quot;Having been made pregnant by the seed of the devil ... she brought forth a son.&quot; Or, in a different translation, &quot;For straightway that impatience conceived of the devil's seed, produced, in the fecundity of malice, anger as her son; and when brought forth, trained him in her own arts.&quot;

=== Spurious Works ===

There have been many works attributed to Tertullian in the past which have since been determined to be almost definitely written by others. Nonetheless, since their actual authors remain uncertain, they continue to be published together in collections of Tertullian's works.

*1. ''Adversus Omnes Haereses'' (Against all Heresies) - poss. [[Victorinus of Pettau]]
*2 ''De execrandis gentium diis''  (On the Execrable Gods of the Heathens)
*3 ''Carmen adversus Marcionem'' (Poem against Marcion)
*4 ''Carmen de Iona Propheta'' (Poem about the Prophet Jonas) - poss. [[Cyprianus Gallus]]
*5 ''Carmen de Sodoma'' (Poem about Sodom) - poss. [[Cyprianus Gallus]]
*6 ''Carmen de Genesi'' (Poem about Genesis)
*7 ''Carmen de Judicio Domini'' (Poem about the Judgment of the Lord)

The popular ''Passio SS. Perpetuae et Felicitatis'' (Martyrdom of SS. Perpetua and Felicitas), much of it the personal diary of St. [[Perpetua]], was once assumed to have been edited by Tertullian. That view is no longer held, and it is usually published separately from Tertullian's works.

[[Image:Alfons Mucha - 1896 - Salammb?.jpg|thumb|Salammb? by [[Alfons Mucha]] (1896)]]
'''''Salammb?''''' (1862) is a [[historical novel]] by [[Gustave Flaubert]].  It is set in [[Carthage]] during the [[3rd century BC|third century BCE]], immediately before and during the [[Mercenary Revolt (Carthage)|Mercenary Revolt]] which took place shortly after the [[First Punic War]]. Flaubert's main source was Book I of [[Polybius]]'s ''Histories''. It was not a particularly well-studied period of history and required a great deal of work from the author, who enthusiastically left behind the [[Literary realism|realism]] of his masterpiece ''[[Madame Bovary]]'' for this tale of blood-and-thunder.

The book, which Flaubert researched painstakingly, is largely an exercise in sensuous and violent exoticism. Following the success of ''[[Madame Bovary]]'', it was another best-seller and sealed his reputation. The Carthaginian costumes described in it even left traces on the fashions of the time. Nevertheless, in spite of its classic status in France, it is not widely known today among English speakers.

==Plot==

After the [[First Punic War]], Carthage is unable to fulfil promises made to its army of mercenaries, and finds itself under attack. The fictional title character, a priestess and the daughter of [[Hamilcar Barca]], an aristocratic Carthaginian general, is the object of the obsessive lust of Matho, a leader of the mercenaries. With the help of the scheming freed slave, Spendius, Matho steals the sacred veil of Carthage, the Za?mph, prompting Salammb? to enter the mercenaries' camp in an attempt to steal it back.  The Za?mph is an ornate bejewelled veil draped about the statue of the goddess [[Tanit]] in the sanctum sanctorum of her temple: the veil is the city's guardian and touching it will bring death to the perpetrator.

*'''Chapter 1.''' ''The Feast.'' During a victory banquet, the mercenaries destroy Hamilcar's garden for sport in his absence. Hamilcar's daughter Salammb? tries to quell the riot. Matho falls in love with her. The slave Spendius is released, and he tries to persuade Matho to take Carthage for the mercenaries.
*'''Chapter 2.''' ''At Sicca.'' The mercenaries leave the city unpaid and travel to Sicca. Later, Hanno comes and speaks to the mercenaries about delays in recompensing them, but he is driven off when Zarxas arrives and tells them of a treacherous massacre of 300 slingers who had stayed behind.
*'''Chapter 3.''' ''Salammb?.'' Hamilcar's daughter prays and is instructed by Schahabarim.
*'''Chapter 4.''' ''Beneath the Walls of Carthage.'' The mercenaries besiege Carthage; Matho and Spendius penetrate via the aqueduct.
*'''Chapter 5.''' ''Tanit.'' Matho and Spendius steal the Za?mph. Because Matho is caught while breaking into Salammb?'s bedroom to see her again, she falls under suspicion of complicity.
*'''Chapter 6.''' ''Hanno.'' The mercenaries leave Carthage and split into two groups, attacking Utica and Hippo-Zarytus. Hanno surprises Spendius at Utica, and occupies the city, but flees when Matho arrives and routs his troops.
*'''Chapter 7.''' ''Hamilcar Barca.'' The hero returns and an attempt is made to blame him for Hanno's losses. He defends himself before the Council and defends the mercenaries, but turns against the barbarians when he sees the damage they have done to his property.
*'''Chapter 8.''' ''The Battle of the Macar.'' Hamilcar defeats Spendius at the bridge of the Macar, three miles from Utica.
*'''Chapter 9.''' ''In the Field.'' Hamilcar's troops are trapped by the mercenaries.
*'''Chapter 10.''' ''The Serpent.'' Schahabarim sends Salammb? in disguise to retrieve the Za?mph.
*'''Chapter 11.''' ''In the Tent.'' Salammb? reaches Matho in his tent at the encampment. Believing each other to be divine apparitions, they make love. The mercenaries are attacked and dispersed by Hamilcar's troops. She takes away the Za?mph, and on meeting her father, Hamilcar has her betrothed to Narr' Havas, a mercenary who has changed sides.
*'''Chapter 12.''' ''The Aqueduct.'' The Carthaginians return to their city with the mercenaries in pursuit. Spendius cuts off the water supply to Carthage.
*'''Chapter 13.''' ''Moloch.'' Carthaginian children are sacrificed to Moloch. Hamilcar disguises a slave-child as his son Hannibal and sends him to die in his son's place.
*'''Chapter 14.''' ''The Defile of the Axe.'' The drought is broken and aid comes. Hamilcar drives the mercenaries away from their encampments. Later, thousands of mercenaries are trapped in a [[defile (geography)|defile]] and slowly starve (the [[Battle of &quot;The Saw&quot;]]). Deaths of Hanno and Spendius, both by crucifixion.
*'''Chapter 15.''' ''Matho.'' Victory celebrations at Carthage. Matho is tortured before his execution; Salammb?, witnessing this, dies of shock.  The Za?mph has brought death upon those who touched it.

==Characters==
The transliterations follow J. W. Matthews's English version.
*Abdalonim, the overseer of Hamilcar's stewards
*[[Autaritus|Autharitus]] (Autharite), a leader of the Mercenaries
*Demonades, a servant of Hanno
*Giddenem, the governor of Hamilcar's slaves
*[[Hasdrubal Gisco|Gisco (Gesco)]], a Carthaginian general
*[[Hamilcar Barca|'''Hamilcar''' Barca (Amilcar)]], Carthaginian general who led the mercenaries before the events of the book
*[[Hannibal]], Hamilcar's young son
*'''Hanno''' (Hannon), a Carthaginian general (based on [[Hanno the Great]] and [[Hannibal (Mercenary War)|Hannibal of the Mercenary War]])
*Iddibal, a servant of Hamilcar
*'''Matho''' ([[M?thos]]), a leader of the Mercenaries
*'''Narr' Havas''' (Flaubert's spelling of [[Naravas]]), prince of the Numidians, and a leader of the Mercenaries
*'''Salammb?''', daughter of Hamilcar
*Schahabarim, high priest of Tanith, and teacher of Salammb?
*'''[[Spendius]]''', a slave of Hamilcar, captured at the battle of Argunisae, who becomes a leader of the Mercenaries during the Revolt
*Taanach, a slave attending Salammb?
*Zarxas ([[Zarzas]]), a leader of the Mercenaries

==Quotations==
The opening words became at once almost proverbial: ''C'?tait ? M?gara, faubourg de Carthage, dans les jardins d'Hamilcar...'' ''&quot;It was at Megara, a suburb of Carthage, in the gardens of Hamilcar, that the soldiers whom he had commanded in Sicily were holding a great feast to celebrate the anniversary of the Battle of Eryx. The master was absent, their numbers were large, and accordingly they ate and drank in perfect freedom.&quot;''

Many readers will remember the chilling passages of chapter 13 (&quot;Moloch&quot;) that describe the burning of the children inside the huge, hollow brass statue of the [[Baal]] [[Moloch]]: ''&quot;The brazen arms were working more quickly. They paused no longer. Every time that a child was placed in them the priests of Moloch spread out their hands upon him to burden him with the crimes of the people, vociferating: &quot;They are not men but oxen!&quot; and the multitude round about repeated: &quot;Oxen! oxen!&quot; The devout exclaimed: &quot;Lord! Eat!&quot;''.

There is also a dramatic account of the boy [[Hannibal]] only narrowly avoiding being sacrificed.

Flaubert departs from Polybius's account in many particulars.  In reality [[Hanno]] was not crucified by the mercenaries; there was a Carthaginian general captured and crucified, but his name was [[Hannibal (Mercenary War)|Hannibal]], and he felt this would have confused his readers.

Hundred and Four

<text>
The '''Hundred and Four''', or Council of 104, was a [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] tribunal of judges.  They were created early in Carthage's history, and are described in Aristotle's ''Politics'' (4th century BC) as &quot;the highest constitutional authority.&quot;  The Hundred and Four were in charge of judging generals and the military, who exercised a great deal of independence from the government in Carthage.  The Hundred and Four were intended to provide a check to insure the military served the needs of the senate and the people. However, by the time of [[Hannibal Barca]], and his stint as [[Suffet]] (early 2nd century BC), the 104 had acquired tyrannical power.{{quote |
?By the old constitution, the Senate had the right to control the magistrates; but this new body of judges controlled the Senate, and therefore, in reality, the magistrates also.  Nor was it content to control the Senate; it practically superseded it...  No Shofete, no Senator, no general, was exempt from their irresponsible despotism.  The Shofetes presided, the senators deliberated, the generals fought, as it were, with a halter around their necks.  The sentences passed by the Hundred, if they were often deserved, were often also, like those of the dreaded [[Council of Ten|?Ten? at Venice]], to whom they bore a striking resemblance, arbitrary and cruel.?&lt;ref&gt;R. Bosworth Smith, ''Carthage and the Carthaginians'' (Longmans, Green, &amp; Co., 1913), p. 24  CF. [[Justin (historian)|Justin]] 19.2.5; [[Aristotle]], ''The Politics'' 2.11.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By leading a populist reform movement?including substituting annual rotation in office for the life tenure formerly enjoyed by the 104?Hannibal managed to restore a measure of popular rule.  Until [[Hannibal]]'s reforms the Hundred and Four held their position for life.  During Hannibal's term as [[Shofet|Suffett]] he used popular support to change the term to a year and to add a term limit of two years.&lt;ref&gt;Justin 19.2.5 and Livy 33.46.4; Serge Lancel, ''Carthage: A History'' (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1995), pp. 114-16, 403; Gilbert &amp; Colette Picard, ''The Life &amp; Death of Carthage'', tr.

The '''Punic language''' or '''Carthagian language''' is an extinct [[Semitic language]] formerly spoken in the Mediterranean region of [[North Africa]] and several [[List of islands in the Mediterranean|Mediterranean islands]], by people of the [[Punic]] or [[Berber people|Berber]] culture.

== Description ==

Punic is an extinct variety of the [[Phoenician language]] spoken in the oversea Phoenician empire in North Africa, including [[Carthage]], and the Mediterranean.  It is known from inscriptions and personal name evidence.  The play ''[[Poenulus]]'' by [[Plautus]] contains a few lines in spoken Punic, which have been subject to some research because, unlike inscriptions, they largely preserve the [[vowel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Les passages puniques en transcription latine dans le Poenulus de Plaute |last= Sznycer |first= Maurice |year= 1967 |publisher= Librairie C. Klincksieck |location= Paris }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Augustine of Hippo]] is generally considered the last major ancient writer to have some knowledge of Punic, and is considered &quot;our primary source on the survival of [late] Punic&quot;. According to him, the Punic language was still spoken in his region (Northern Africa) in the 5th century AD, centuries after the fall of Carthage, and there were still people who called themselves &quot;chanani&quot; ([[Canaan]]ite, i.e: Carthaginian) at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Late Punic Epigraphy |author= Jongeling. Karel; &amp; Kerr, Robert M. |year= 2005 |publisher= Mohr Siebeck |isbn= 3161487281 |pages= 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing around AD&amp;nbsp;401, he says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Quae lingua si improbatur abs te, nega Punicis libris, ut a viris doctissimis proditur, multa sapienter esse mandata memoriae. Poeniteat te certe ibi natum, ubi huius linguae cunabula recalent.''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
And if the Punic language is rejected by you, you virtually deny what has been admitted by most learned men, that many things have been wisely preserved from oblivion in books written in the Punic tongue. Nay, you ought even to be ashamed of having been born in the country in which the cradle of this language is still warm. (Ep. xvii)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The idea that Punic exerted an influence on the modern [[Maltese language]] was first raised in 1565.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Maltese Language Academy | url=http://www.akkademjatalmalti.com/page.asp?p=9023 | author=L-Akkademja tal-Malti}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory has been mostly discredited; mainstream theories hold Maltese to be derived from [[Sicilian Arabic|Siculo-Arabic]], with a large number of [[loanwords]] from [[Italian language|Italian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Aspects of Multilingualism in European Language History |last= Vella |first= Alexandra |editor= Kurt Braunm?ller

'''''Hannibal's Children''''' is the 2002 [[alternate history]] [[novel]] by [[John Maddox Roberts]].

==Plot introduction==
The [[Carthaginians]] won the [[Second Punic War]] against the [[Roman Republic|Romans]]. The defeated Romans were forced to go into exile north of the [[Danube River]].  Years later a Roman expedition heads south to see what has changed in the world and meets the heirs of [[Hannibal]] who have become kings, or [[Shofet]], of Carthage.

==Plot summary==

The novel opens at the alternate close of the [[Second Punic War]]. Hannibal offers terms to the Romans: abandon your city and move north of the Alps, or be destroyed. The Romans, under the dictator [[Fabius Maximus|Q. Fabius Maximus]], accept the offer and withdraw into [[Germania]], vowing to return. The Carthaginians declare victory and go home.

One chapter and several generations later, the Romans have long since reestablished their republic. These Romans, largely out of need, have adopted a practice of [[Romanization (cultural)|Cultural Romanization]] more pronounced than the historical Romans did: large numbers of Germans have been adopted into the Roman society, forming a large proportion of both the legions and the Senate. A series of auspicious omens prompt the Senate to send a delegation south into Latium. The expedition leaders are subtly but immediately at cross purposes: the commander, Marcus Scipio, a scion of the ancient patrician [[Scipio (cognomen)|Cornelii Scipiones]] family, is wholly motivated by a desire to reestablish the Republic in the Mediterranean basin. His deputy, Titus Norbanus, one of the newer, Germanic Romans, seeks personal glory, at least in part to ensure that the Germans (particularly his own family) remain as powerful within the expanded Republic as they do under the current scheme. It quickly becomes clear to the Romans that generations of constant warfare in Germania have strengthened them, whereas the Carthaginians have grown soft in the absence of real opposition. The Republic quickly begins playing the Carthaginians off against the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Egyptians]] (the only other serious power in the Mediterranean), reclaiming Latium in the process. At the close of the novel, the Egyptian army led by Scipio vanquishes the Carthaginian force, in which four Roman legions led by Norbanus are technically serving. The sequel follows Norbanus's trek back to friendly territory and his march towards power.

==Characters in ''Hannibal's Children''==
;Marcus Scipio: Leader of Roman Expedition to Carthage and Egypt
;Titus Norbanus: Second in command of Roman Expedition
;Selene: Queen of Egypt
;Hamilcar: Shofet of Carthage

==Major themes==
As with Roberts's [[SPQR series|other series]], ''Hannibal's Children'' and its sequel ''[[The Seven Hills]]'' explore the decline of the Republic in the face of ambition. In the former, the [[Caesar (title)|Caesars]] and in the latter Norbanus aggressively pursue power for its own sake, in the process exposing weaknesses in the Republic.

{{Unreferenced|date=June 2007}}'''Empress Bo''' ({{zh|c=???|p=B? Hu?ngh?u}}) (personal name unknown) (died 147 BC) was an [[empress#China|empress]] during the [[Han Dynasty]].  She was the first wife of [[Emperor Jing of Han|Emperor Jing]].
Empress Bo was from the family of [[Empress Dowager Bo]], who was probably her paternal grandaunt and betrothed her to her grandson, then-Crown Prince Qi during the reign of her son, [[Emperor Wen of Han|Emperor Wen]]. She carried the title of crown princess during the reign of her father-in-law. Then, when her husband became emperor in 157 BC, she was created empress, but she was not favored by her husband, and she had no sons. It was as a consequence of this that [[Consort Li (Jing)|Consort Li]]'s son [[Liu Rong]] was made crown prince.

After Grand Empress Dowager Bo died in 155 BC, Empress Bo lost her source of support within the palace.  In 151 BC, her husband deposed her.  She died four years later.&lt;ref&gt;Lily Xiao Hong Lee, A. D.

==History==
The origin of French nationalism and French patriotism is viewed to have begun with [[Joan of Arc]] who fought for France and always addressed her supporters as &quot;Frenchmen&quot;.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=171}} French nationalism rose as a movement after the [[French Revolution]] in 1789.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=171}} [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] promoted French nationalism based upon the ideals of the French Revolution such as the ideal of &quot;[[liberty, equality, fraternity]]&quot; and justified French expansionism and French military campaigns on the claim that France had the right to spread the enlightened ideals of the French Revolution across Europe.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=171}} Napoleon's invasions of other nations had the effect of spreading the concept of nationalism outside of France.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=171}}

After Napoleon's defeat and downfall, French nationalism from the 19th to early 20th century took on an an assertive and extreme patriotism that supported military force to achieve its political goals.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=171}} During [[World War I]] France pursued [[Irredentism|irredentist]] claims on the region of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] that had been lost by France to [[Germany]] at the end of the [[Franco-German War]] of 1870-1871. French national pride was damaged in [[World War I]] by the long, drawn out war with Germany fought on its soil, especially in [[World War II]] when the French government surrendered to Germany in 1940, and after France lost many of its colonies due to decolonization after World War II.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=171}}

The [[war hero]] of [[Free France]], [[Charles de Gaulle]] became [[President of France]] and sought to ressurect national pride.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=171}} De Gaulle sought to make France the leader of an independent Europe - free from American and Soviet influence.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=172}} De Gaulle's government sought Franco-German reconciliation and took a leading role in the founding of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] that  sought to resolve economic tensions between France and Germany, that French foreign minister [[Robert Schuman]] declared was designed &quot;to end Franco-German hostility once and for all.&quot;.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=172}}

Horse breeding in France
</title>

</id>
<text>
'''Horse breeding in France''' is a known practice since Celtic times. Linked to political prestige, military effectiveness and the need to obtain animals from daily work, he passes from the hands of wealthy lords and monasteries in the Middle Ages to those of French kings, through the National Stud created by [[Louis XIV]] and [[Colbert]] to control the private breeding. Its history is closely related to human activities and needs of each era with the emergence or disappearance of specific types of horses (horses for war, work, carriage, draft, racing, sport...) according to the uses and needs. The [[cavalry]] and transport for people or materials, in particular, are the two main motivations for this. If the reputation of the French working horses, and especially the [[Percheron]], is known all around the world, the military riding horse is poor. The organization of the breeding and the creation of studbooks only dates from the late nineteenth century.The [[engine]] and the progress of [[agriculture]] are largely backward farming in the twentieth century. Inducing techniques with the end of military and commercial uses of the horse, breeders are now found four main outlets. Especially for horse racing Thoroughbred farms and French trotters, the latter being most common. Some personalities like [[Jean-Pierre Dubois]] are renowned breeders. The sport has revealed some equine athletes [[Selle Fran?ais]] and [[Anglo-Arab]], as [[Jappeloup]]. Recreational riding, or the company, still growing although the number of horses adapted remains reduced, with some local initiatives such as the successful [[Henson (horse)|Henson]]. Finally, meat production breeds (draft horses) almost exclusively deals with the exportation or horses reform. 900,000 horses are recorded in France in 2008. The National Stud disengage gradually tutelage of their long history of private farming, the many reforms in the sector were finally conducted, since 2010, the creation of the Institut fran?ais du cheval et de l'?quitation.

Horse breeding is entirely within the agricultural sector since 2005, it is subject to rules regarding the identification, sale, selection of breeding techniques and monitoring of births. The French government still distributes bonuses for the birth of foals and endangered breeds of livestock competitions or recovery sports for young horses. Ranchers gather themselves into associations, unions and federations to defend and promote their business.

'''''In&amp;Out''''',&lt;ref&gt;The written form of the logo is In&amp;Out (sometimes In &amp; Out), the association preferring to use the ampersand in the title of the festival and not ?In and Out?.&lt;/ref&gt; also known as ''Rencontres Cin?matographiques'', is the [[lesbian]] and [[gay]] film festival of [[Nice]].  With an always very eclectic programming, the festival?s originators, the ''Les Ouvreurs'' association, take over several of Nice?s cultural sites for a week of screenings.  Filmgoers are invited to meet artists involved and to share their impressions on the films which are shown within daily themes (A day with?, Seen from elsewhere ?, Documentaries?), discovering new ways of going to the cinema in a convivial spirit.  The event takes place each year in April, during the school vacations, to allow as many as possible to participate.
Since the end of 2011, the festival has endowed itself with a tag line: '''''Nice Queer Film Festival''''', the term [[queer]] reflecting a will to be part of a more universal world.

== History ==
=== The beginnings of In&amp;Out ===

Wanting to offer the public of Nice a Festival of Gay and Lesbian Film, Beno?t Arnulf organizes, under the aegis of a local [[LGBT]] association that he co-founded, the Rencontres cinematographiques (Cinematographic Encounters) in partnership with certain Nice cinemas.  The event arouses a real interest, nearly a 1000 spectators turning out to see the twenty or so films programmed and to meet the directors invited: [[Jacques Nolot]], [[C?line Sciamma]] and [[Alessandro Avelis]].

=== In&amp;Out 2009: The first Rencontres ===

The success of 2008?s Rencontres incites Les Ouvreurs to organize an identical event, under a new name: In&amp;Out.  The first Rencontres In&amp;Out takes place from April 29 to May 5, 2009, in partnership with divers cultural sites in Nice.  Eclecticism reigns again in the programming, which proposes two retrospectives (of [[Andr? T?chin?]] and of [[Olivier Ducastel]] &amp; [[Jacques Martineau]]), a homage to film-maker poet [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]], a [[Rocky Horror Show]] evening as lively in the audience as on the screen, and hitherto unreleased films ([[Otto; or Up With Dead People]] by [[Bruce LaBruce]], ''Give Me Your Hand'' by [[Pascal-Alex Vincent]],  ''Les r?gles du Vatican'' by Alessandro Avellis).  The critic [[Didier Roth-Bettoni]] comes to present his book, ?L?homosexualit? au cinema? and an exhibition of photographs celebrates the 30th anniversary of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence.

=== In&amp;Out 2010: ?Memory &amp; memoirs? ===

For its second edition In&amp;Out takes place under its central theme of ?Memory &amp; Memoirs? and continues its efforts to diversify with nearly 30 films screened.  Two homages are made: the first to [[Magnus Hirschfeld]], the Munich sexologist; and the second to the French writer [[Herv? Guibert]], around a very moving and sincere oeuvre of words and images.  Like each year, encounters with film-makers are organized ? with [[S?bastien Lifshitz]], [[Panos H. Koutras]], Olivier Ducastel and Jacques Martineau, [[Louis Dupont]], [[Jean-Gabriel P?riot]] ? broaching themes such as the ?[[transgender]] question?, the deportation of the ?Pink Triangles?, homosexuality in sport, and a focus on [[Greece]].  And previously unreleased films opening and closing the festival give Lesbian cinema its due with ''Ghosted'' by [[Monika Treut]] and ''El Nino Pez'' by [[Lucia Puenza]].

=== In&amp;Out 2011 : Intimacy ===

The 3rd Rencontres In&amp;Out will be held from April 19 to 27 2011.  This year the accent is on Intimacy, the festival welcoming several film-makers who work in the light of this theme.  Present during the [[Jo?o Pedro Rodrigues]] (''Two Drifters'', ''To Die Like a Man'' and ?O Fantasma?, [[Emilie Jouvet]] (''Too Much Pussy!'') and [[Vincent Dieutre]] (''Ea2, 2e exercice d'admiration : Jean Eustache'', ''Ea3, 3e exercice d?admiration : Jean Cocteau'', ''My Winter Journey'', give their iconoclastic (to say the least) views on sexuality, desire and amorous passion.  Once again, In&amp;Out welcomes C?line Sciamma for ''Tomboy'', her latest film, rewarded at the [[Berlin Festival]], and Louis Dupont, who closes his great trilogy on the aesthetics of the body with ''Les gar?ons du Lido''.

Audacity, eclecticism, and originality are as always in charge of the programming, two thirds of the 30 films being previously unreleased in Nice.  This year the Festival pays homage to memory of gay and lesbian culture through the philosopher [[Michel Foucault]], the writer [[Jean Genet]], the German film-maker [[Werner Schroeter]] and the journalist and writer [[Jean Le Bitoux]].  To that must be added, among others a rich programming of documentaries, with: ''Cuchillo de Palo'' by [[Renate Costa]] who reminds the viewers of the painful memory of [[Paraguay]] under the dictatorship of [[Stroessner]]; ''Beyond Gay'', a reflection on [[Gay Pride Marches]]; or ''Miwa, A Japanese Icon'' by Pascal-Alex Vincent about [[Japan]]?s most popular actress of the 1960s.  Several films might be called ?disreputable?, such as [[Killer Kondom]] by [[Martin Waltz]] or the latest two films with [[Fran?ois Sagat]]: [[Homme au bain]] by [[Christophe Honor?]], and [[L.A. Zombie]]? by Bruce LaBruce.
2011?s edition of the Festival had a record number of people attending ? 2350 over 9 days.

=== In&amp;Out 2012 : ? In preparation ? ===
The 4th Rencontres In&amp;Out will take place April 24 to May 3, 2012, the programming having yet to be announced.
As each year, Les Ouvreurs partner with other cultural associations in Nice, as well as local institutions, in order to propose a significant programme of [[LGTB cinema]].

== Around the In&amp;Out Festival ==
=== ?Jeune Public? Sessions ===

In parallel to the 2008 Festival, the first ?Jeune Public? session is held for school students from Nice.  The session includes a screening of the [[Argentine]] film [[XXY]] by [[Lucia Puenzo]] and a discussion around the theme of ?[[homosexuality]] and [[gender]]? led by specialist contributors.  In 2009, two sessions were held for two classes in one of Nice?s Lyc?es, one with the Argentine film [[Glue]] by [[Alexis Dos Santos]], and the other, in class, with short films by Pascal-Alex Vincent (''Far West'' and ''Hollywood malgr? lui'').  The screenings were followed by debates, again with specialist contributors, leading the students to reflect on questions related to homosexuality.  During 2010, 2011 and 2012, Les Ouvreurs took part one hundred times in events in Nice?s schools.

=== Quartier d'?t? ===

Les Ouvreurs also lead one-off activities outside the dates of the Festival.  Summer 2009 saw the launch of a new event, Quartier d??t?, free open-air screenings in the heart of Old Nice.  The spirit of popular cinema drives these screenings and the choice falls on [[James Whale]], homosexual director of American [[horror movies]] of the 1930s, with screenings of [[Frankenstein]], [[The Bride of Frankenstein]], the [[Invisible Man]] and the biopic [[Gods &amp; Monsters]].  For the second season of Quartier d??t? in 2010, the choice is the cinema of musicals with the legendary [[Cabaret]] by [[Bob Fosse]] opening the ball.  The 3rd season, in 2011, continues in the same vein with [[Some Like it Hot]] by [[Billy Wilder]].

=== World AIDS Day ===

Moreover, Les Ouvreurs are asked by the ''Collectif de lutte contre le sida des Alpes-Maritimes'' (ACTES, AIDES, ASA, CODES 06, Sida Info Service, CDAG du CG06) to propose a program of cinema related to AIDS for the World AIDS Day on December 1.  Six films are shown in Nice?s cinemas:  [[Philadelphia]], by  [[Jonathan Demme]], the first major Hollywood film on [[AIDS]]; [[Don't Forget You're Going to Die]], by [[Xavier Beauvois]], awarded the 1995 prix du jury of the [[Cannes Film Festival]]; [[Close to Leo]], previously without a cinema release; [[the Living End]] by [[Gregg Araki]], jewel of ?New Queer Cinema?, and the unreleased [[Sex Positive]] by [[Daryl Wein]], which Les Ouvreurs had sub-titled for the occasion.

=== Pink Parade ===
In July 2010, the Ouvreurs allied themselves once more to Sida Info Service and la Mutualit? fran?aise during the 7th ''March? des Fiert?s ni?oise'', the Pink Parade (the equivalent to the [[Gay Pride]] in Nice).

=== Queer in the City ===
Since October 2011, Les Ouvreurs have run a monthly session of cinema (or theatre) with LGBT themes at la ''Cit?'' theatre, with the aim of allowing Nice?s public to discover or rediscover cult films such as the [[Rocky Horror Picture Show]] by [[Jim Sharmen]] or [[Derek Jarman]]?s [[Edward II (film)|Edward II]].

=== In&amp;Out and other European Events ===
Les Ouvreurs continue to pursue the efforts to link up with other festivals and events, whether LGBT or not, such as [[Pink Screens]] ([[Brussels]]), the [[Queer Palm]] of the Cannes Film Festival, Ecrans mixtes ([[Lyon]]), [[Ch?ries-Ch?ris]] ([[Paris]]) and Polar ? Drap (Drap).

The '''Service d'exploitation de la formation a?ronautique''' ('''SEFA''') was the [[France|French]] national [[flight school]], located in nine places in [[France]] and managed by the [[direction g?n?rale de l'aviation civile]] (DGAC). It merged with [[?cole nationale de l'aviation civile]] the 1st of january 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}}[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000023236509&amp;dateTexte=&amp;categorieLien=id D?cret n? 2010-1552 du 15 d?cembre 2010 modifiant le d?cret n? 2007-651 du 30 avril 2007 portant statut de l'Ecole nationale de l'aviation civile - Version consolid?e au 01 janvier 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;{{,}}&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}}[http://www.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/spip.php?page=article&amp;id_article=20443 Fusion de l?Ecole Nationale de l?Aviation Civile (ENAC) et du Service d?Exploitation de la Formation A?ronautique (SEFA)]&lt;/ref&gt;.

== History ==

=== The development of light aviation between the two world war ===

SEFA is a direct descendant of a long tradition of state involvement in helping to light [[aviation]]. By 1936, the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] creates the &quot;''sections d?aviation populaire''&quot; (SAP), in order to democratize the flight training for young people and then to train more crew for the French military aviation. In 1946, the &quot;''service de l?aviation l?g?re et sportive''&quot; (SALS) is created, which purpose is essentially to provide available aircrafts and [[Flight instructor|flight instructor]] for [[Flying club|flying clubs]].

=== Many successive names ===

In 1955, SALS becomes the &quot;''service de la formation a?ronautique et des sports a?riens''&quot; (SFASA), in 1959 the &quot;''service de la formation a?ronautique, du travail a?rien et des transports''&quot; (SFATAT), in 1964 it is renamed &quot;''service de la formation a?ronautique''&quot; (SFA) and finally the &quot;''service de la formation a?ronautique et du contr?le technique''&quot; (SFACT) in 1976&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}}[http://www.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/IMG/SFACTRapport03.pdf Rapport annuel 2003 SFACT]&lt;/ref&gt;. These designations reflect the successive changes in the organization of the [[Direction G?n?rale de l'Aviation Civile|civil aviation administration]], but also the direct involvement of the State, in flight training. Thus &quot;national centers&quot; will be created, in 1945, for the [[gliding]] activities ([[Challes-les-Eaux]], [[Beynes, Yvelines|Beynes]], [[Pont-Saint-Vincent]], etc.), and then for the flight in piston aircrafts ([[Carcassonne]] in 1945, [[Saint-Yan]] in 1947), and even [[skydiving]] ([[Biscarosse]] in 1953).

=== A new mission: to train airline pilots ===

Over the years, the [[Direction G?n?rale de l'Aviation Civile|French civil aviation administration]] gradually withdraw from its activities in the field of [[gliding]] and [[skydiving]].
In 1959, the center of [[Saint-Yan]] welcomes the first course of airline pilot students (EPL), ushering in a new mission of the SEFA : the training of [[Airline pilot|airline pilots]]. The national centers were attached to the service of the [[Direction G?n?rale de l'Aviation Civile|civil aviation administration]] in charge of training. The creation of a single management structure was needed.
Thus was created the SEFA in 1993, bringing together under one organization all the necessary needs to implement the tasks entrusted by the DGAC. The direction of the SEFA moved to [[Muret]] in 1996, bringing together all central services previously scattered between [[Saint-Cyr-l'?cole]] and [[Paris]].

=== The merger with ?cole nationale de l'aviation civile ===

Finally, on the 1st of January 2011, the SEFA is merged with the [[?cole nationale de l'aviation civile]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Fusion ENAC/SEFA&quot;/&gt; in order to create the biggest [[Europe|European]] aviation school&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}}[http://www.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/spip.php?page=article&amp;id_article=20442 La France dispose de la plus grande ?cole d?aviation europ?enne]&lt;/ref&gt;. All the SEFA activities are now providing under the only acronym [[?cole nationale de l'aviation civile|ENAC]]&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}}[http://www.performance-publique.budget.gouv.fr/farandole/2012/pap/html/DBGPGMPRESSTRATPGM611.htm Patrick GANDIL - Directeur g?n?ral de l?aviation civile - Responsable du programme n? 611 : Formation a?ronautique]&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Germany''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-uk-Germany.ogg|?|d?|?r|m|?|n|i}}), officially the '''Federal Republic of Germany''' ({{lang-de|Bundesrepublik Deutschland}}, {{IPA-de|?b?nd?s?epu?bli?k ?d??t?lant|pron|De-Bundesrepublik_Deutschland.ogg}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Mangold, Max |title=Duden, Aussprachew?rterbuch |edition=6th |year=1995 |publisher=Dudenverlag  |language=German |isbn= 9783411209163 |pages=271, 53f}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[federation|federal]] [[parliamentary republic]] in [[Europe]]. The country consists of [[Lands of Germany|16 states]] while the [[capital city|capital]] and [[List of cities in Germany by population|largest city]] is [[Berlin]]. Germany covers an area of 357,021&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With 81.8&amp;nbsp;million inhabitants, it is the most populous member state and the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|largest economy]] in the [[European Union]]. It is one of the major political powers of the European continent and a technological leader in many fields.

A region named [[Germania]], inhabited by several [[Germanic people]]s, was [[Germania (book)|documented]] before AD&amp;nbsp;100. During the [[Migration Age]], the [[Germanic tribes]] expanded southward, and established successor kingdoms throughout much of [[Europe]]. Beginning in the 10th century, [[Germans|German]] territories formed a central part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;The Latin name ''Sacrum Imperium'' (Holy Empire) is documented as far back as 1157. The Latin name ''Sacrum Romanum Imperium'' (Holy Roman Empire) was first documented in 1254. The full name &quot;Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation&quot; (''Heiliges R?misches Reich Deutscher Nation'') dates back to the 15th century.&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book | last = Zippelius| first = Reinhold| title = Kleine deutsche Verfassungsgeschichte: vom fr?hen Mittelalter bis zur Gegenwart| trans_title   = Brief German Constitutional History: from the Early Middle Ages to the Present| edition   = 7| origyear  = 1994| year  = 2006| publisher =Beck| location  = Munich| language  = German| isbn  = 9783406476389| page = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 16th century, northern German regions became the centre of the [[Protestant Reformation]] while southern and western parts remained dominated by [[Roman Catholic]] denominations, with the two factions clashing in the [[Thirty Years' War]], marking the beginning of the Catholic?[[Protestant]] divide that has characterized German society ever since.&lt;ref name=&quot;georgetown1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/germany |title=Germany |work= |publisher=[[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]] |date= |accessdate=2011-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occupied during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the rise of [[Pan-Germanism]] inside the [[German Confederation]] resulted in the unification of most of the German states into the [[unification of Germany|German Empire]] in 1871 which was [[Prussia]]n dominated. After the [[German Revolution of 1918?1919]] and the subsequent military surrender in [[World War I]], the Empire was replaced by the [[Weimar Republic]] in 1918, and partitioned in the [[Versailles Treaty]]. Amidst the [[Great Depression]], the [[Third Reich]] was proclaimed in 1933. The latter period was marked by [[Fascism]] and the [[Second World War]]. After 1945, Germany was divided by [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|allied occupation]], and evolved into two states, [[East Germany]] and [[West Germany]]. In 1990 Germany was [[German reunification|reunified]].

Germany was a founding member of the [[European Communities|European Community]] in 1957, which became the EU in 1993. It is part of the [[Schengen Area]] and since 1999 a member of the [[eurozone]]. Germany is a member of the [[United Nations]], [[NATO]], the [[G8]], the [[G-20 major economies|G20]], the [[OECD]] and the [[Council of Europe]], and took a non-permanent seat on the [[UN Security Council]] for the 2011?2012 term.

It has the world's [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|fourth largest economy]] by nominal [[GDP]] and the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|fifth largest]] by [[purchasing power parity]]. It is the [[List of countries by exports|second largest exporter]] and [[List of countries by imports|third largest importer]] of goods. The country has developed a [[List of countries by Human Development Index|very high standard of living]] and a comprehensive system of [[social security]]. Germany has been the home of many influential [[Science and technology in Germany|scientists and inventors]], and is known for its [[Culture of Germany|cultural]] and [[politics of Germany|political]] [[history of Germany|history]].

==Etymology==&lt;!--linked--&gt;
{{Main|Names of Germany}}
The English word ''Germany'' derives from the Latin [[Germania]], which came into use after [[Julius Caesar]] adopted it for the peoples east of the [[Rhine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Schulze |first=Hagen |authorlink=Hagen Schulze |title=Germany: A New History |publisher= Harvard University Press |page=4 |year=1998 |isbn= 0-674-80688-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other languages it has [[Names of Germany|various names]].

The [[German language|German]] term ''Deutschland'' (originally ''diutisciu land'', &quot;the German lands&quot;) is derived from [[wikt:deutsch#German|''deutsch'']], descended from [[Old High German]] ''diutisc'' &quot;popular&quot; (i. e., belonging to the ''diot'' or ''diota'' &quot;people&quot;; originally used to distinguish the [[Vernacular|language of the common people]] from Latin and its Romance descendants). This in turn descends from [[Proto-Germanic]] [[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/?iudiskaz|*''?iudiskaz'']] &quot;popular&quot; (see also the Latinised form [[Theodiscus]]), derived from [[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/?eud?|*''?eud?'']], descended from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] [[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/tewt?h?|*''tewt?h?-'']] &quot;people&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lloyd|first=Albert L.|title=Etymologisches W?rterbuch des Althochdeutschen, Band II|year=1998|publisher=Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht|location=G?ttingen|isbn=3-525-20768-9|pages=699?704|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iKfYGNwwNVIC&amp;pg=PA523|coauthors=L?hr, Rosemarie; Springer, Otto|language=German}} (for ''diutisc'')

===Germanic tribes and Frankish Empire===
{{Main|Germania|Migration Period}}
[[File:Imperium Romanum Germania.png|thumb|250px|left|Map of the [[Germania]] and the [[Roman Empire]]]]
The [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] are [[ethnogenesis|thought to date from]] the [[Nordic Bronze Age]] or the [[Pre-Roman Iron Age]]. From southern Scandinavia and north Germany, they expanded south, east and west from the 1st century&amp;nbsp;BC, coming into contact with the [[Celt]]ic tribes of [[Gaul]] as well as [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]], [[Balts|Baltic]], and [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] tribes in [[Eastern Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first =Jill N. |last = Claster |title =Medieval Experience: 300?1400 |publisher =New York University Press |year =1982 |page =35 |isbn=0-8147-1381-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Augustus]], the Roman General [[Publius Quinctilius Varus]] began to invade Germania (an area extending roughly from the [[Rhine]] to the [[Ural Mountains]]). In AD&amp;nbsp;9, three [[Roman legion]]s led by Varus were [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest|defeated]] by the [[Cheruscan]] leader [[Arminius]]. By AD&amp;nbsp;100, when [[Tacitus]] wrote ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', Germanic tribes had settled along the Rhine and the Danube (the [[Limes Germanicus]]), occupying most of the area of modern Germany; Austria, southern [[Bavaria]] and the western [[Rhineland]], however, were Roman provinces.&lt;ref name=&quot;9-13&quot;&gt;Fulbrook 1991, pp. 9?13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 3rd century a number of large West Germanic tribes emerged: [[Alamanni]], [[Franks]], [[Chatti]], [[Saxons]], [[Frisii]], [[Sicambri]], and [[Thuringii]]. Around 260, the Germanic peoples broke into Roman-controlled lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |series= The Cambridge Ancient History |title =The crisis of empire, A.D. 193?337 |volume =12 |page =442 |isbn=0-521-30199-8 |first =Alan K. |last =Bowman |first2 =Peter |last2 =Garnsey |first3 =Averil |last3 =Cameron |publisher =Cambridge University Press |year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the invasion of the [[Huns]] in 375, and with the decline of Rome from 395, Germanic tribes moved further south-west. Simultaneously several large tribes formed in what is now Germany and displaced the smaller Germanic tribes. Large areas (known since the [[Merovingian]] period as [[Austrasia]]) were occupied by the [[Frankish Empire|Franks]], and Northern Germany was ruled by the Saxons and Slavs.&lt;ref name=&quot;9-13&quot;/&gt;

===Holy Roman Empire===
{{Main|Holy Roman Empire}}
[[File:Martin Luther by Lucas Cranach der ?ltere.jpeg|thumb|140px|upright|left|[[Martin Luther]] initiated the [[Protestant Reformation]].]]

On 25 December 800, [[Charlemagne]] founded the [[Carolingian Empire]], which was [[Treaty of Verdun|divided in 843]].&lt;ref name=&quot;f11&quot;&gt;Fulbrook 1991, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The Holy Roman Empire resulted from the [[East Francia|eastern portion]] of this division. Its territory stretched from the [[Eider River]] in the north to the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast in the south.&lt;ref name=&quot;f11&quot;/&gt; Under the reign of the [[Ottonian]] emperors (919?1024), several major [[Stem duchy|duchies]] were consolidated, and the German king was crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]] of these regions in 962. The Holy Roman Empire absorbed northern Italy and [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] under the reign of the [[Salian]] emperors (1024?1125), although the emperors lost power through the [[Investiture Controversy]].

Under the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors (1138?1254), the German princes increased their influence further south and east into territories inhabited by [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]], preceding [[History of German settlement in Eastern Europe|German settlement]] in these areas and further east ''([[Ostsiedlung]])''. Northern German towns grew prosperous as members of the [[Hanseatic League]].&lt;ref&gt;Fulbrook 1991, pp. 13?24.&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with the [[Great Famine of 1315?1317|Great Famine]] in 1315, then the [[Black Death]] of 1348?50, the population of Germany plummeted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url =http://www.vlib.us/medieval/lectures/black_death.html |title =The Great Famine (1315?1317) and the Black Death (1346?1351) |first =Lynn Harry |last =Nelson |publisher =University of Kansas |accessdate =19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The edict of the [[Golden Bull of 1356|Golden Bull]] in 1356 provided the basic constitution of the empire and codified the election of the emperor by seven [[prince-elector]]s who ruled some of the most powerful principalities and archbishoprics.&lt;ref&gt;Fulbrook 1991, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Luther]] publicised his [[The 95 Theses|95 Theses]] in 1517, challenging the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and initiating the [[Protestant Reformation]]. A separate [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church became the official religion in many German states after 1530. Religious conflict led to the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618?1648), which devastated German lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Philpott|first=Daniel|title=The Religious Roots of Modern International Relations|journal=World Politics|date=January 2000|volume=52|issue=2|pages=206?245}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population of the German states was reduced by about 30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title =The savage wars of peace: England, Japan and the Malthusian trap |first =Alan |last= Macfarlane |publisher =Blackwell |year = 1997 |page=51 | isbn= 9780631181170}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Peace of Westphalia]] (1648) ended religious warfare among the German states, but the empire was ''de facto'' divided into numerous independent principalities. From 1740 onwards, [[German dualism|dualism]] between the Austrian [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] dominated German history. In 1806, the ''Imperium'' was overrun and dissolved as a result of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;Fulbrook 1991, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

===German Confederation and Empire===
{{Main|German Confederation|German Empire|Pan-Germanism}}
Following the fall of [[Napoleon I of France]], the [[Congress of Vienna]] convened in 1814 and founded the German Confederation (Deutscher Bund), a loose league of [[List of German Confederation member states|39 sovereign states]]. Disagreement with [[European Restoration|restoration]] politics partly led to the rise of [[Liberalism in Germany|liberal]] movements, followed by new measures of repression by Austrian statesman [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Metternich]]. The ''[[Zollverein]]'', a tariff union, furthered economic unity in the German states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Henderson |first=W. O. |title=The Zollverein |journal=History |date=January 1934 |volume=19 |issue=73 |pages=1?19 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-229X.1934.tb01791.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[nationalism|National]] and liberal ideals of the [[French Revolution]] gained increasing support among many, especially young, Germans. In the light of a [[Revolutions of 1848|series of revolutionary movements in Europe]], which established a republic [[Revolutions of 1848 in France|in France]], intellectuals and commoners started the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states]]. King [[Frederick William IV of Prussia]] was offered the title of Emperor, but with a loss of power; he rejected the crown and the proposed constitution, leading to a temporary setback for the movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;state&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Wernerprokla.jpg|thumb|Foundation of the German Empire in [[Versailles]], 1871. [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] is at the centre in a white uniform.]]
Conflict between King [[William I, German Emperor|William I]] of Prussia and the increasingly liberal parliament erupted over military reforms in 1862, and the king appointed [[Otto von Bismarck]] the new [[Prime Minister of Prussia]]. Bismarck successfully waged [[Second War of Schleswig|war on Denmark]] in 1864. Prussian victory in the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866 enabled him to create the [[North German Federation]] (Norddeutscher Bund) and to exclude [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], formerly the leading German state, from the federation's affairs. After the French defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the German Empire was proclaimed 1871 in [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], uniting all scattered parts of Germany except Austria ({{lang|de|[[Kleindeutsche L?sung|''Kleindeutschland'']]}}, or &quot;Lesser Germany&quot;). With almost two thirds of its territory and population, Prussia was the dominating constituent of the new state; the [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] King of Prussia ruled as its concurrent Emperor, and Berlin became its capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;state&quot;/&gt; In the {{lang|de|''[[Gr?nderzeit]]''}} period following the [[unification of Germany]], Bismarck's foreign policy as [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] of Germany under Emperor William I secured Germany's position as a great nation by forging alliances, isolating [[French Third Republic|France]] by diplomatic means, and avoiding war. Under [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], however, Germany, like other European powers, took an [[New Imperialism|imperialistic]] course leading to friction with neighbouring countries. As a result of the [[Berlin Conference]] in 1884 Germany claimed several [[List of former German colonies|colonies]] including [[German East Africa]], [[German South-West Africa]], [[Togoland|Togo]], and [[Cameroon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=100 maps |year=2005 |publisher=Sterling Publishing |isbn=9781402728853 |editor=Black, John |page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most alliances in which Germany had previously been involved were not renewed, and new alliances excluded the country.&lt;ref&gt;Fulbrook 1991, pp. 135, 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassination]] of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Austria's crown prince]] on 28 June 1914 triggered [[World War I]]. Germany, as part of the [[Central Powers]], suffered defeat against the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] in [[World War I casualties|one of the bloodiest]] conflicts of all time. An estimated two million German soldiers died in World War I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,530319,00.html |title = Last German World War I Veteran Believed to Have Died |work =Spiegel Online |date =22 January 2008 |first =David |last =Crossland |accessdate=25 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[German Revolution of 1918?1919|German Revolution]] broke out in November 1918, and Emperor Wilhelm II and all German ruling princes [[abdication|abdicated]]. An [[Armistice with Germany (Compi?gne)|armistice]] ended the war on 11 November, and Germany was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in June 1919. The treaty was perceived in Germany as a humiliating continuation of the war, and is often cited as an influence in the rise of [[Nazism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first =Stephen J. |last =Lee |title =Europe, 1890?1945 |publisher =Routledge |year =2003 |page =131 |isbn = 9780415254557}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(shortened &amp; paraphrased)}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
At the beginning of the German Revolution in November 1918, Germany was declared a [[republic]]. However, the struggle for power continued, with radical-left communists [[Bavarian Socialist Republic|seizing power in Bavaria]]. The revolution came to an end on 11 August 1919, when the democratic [[Weimar Constitution]] was signed by [[President of Germany|President]] [[Friedrich Ebert]].&lt;ref&gt;Fulbrook 1991, pp. 156?160.&lt;/ref&gt; Suffering from the [[Great Depression]] of 1929, the harsh peace conditions dictated by the Treaty of Versailles, and a long succession of unstable governments, Germans increasingly lacked identification with the government. This was exacerbated by a widespread right-wing {{lang|de|''[[Dolchsto?legende]]''}}, or stab-in-the-back myth, which argued that Germany had lost World War I because of those who wanted to overthrow the government. The Weimar government was accused of betraying Germany by signing the Versailles Treaty. By 1932, the [[Communist Party of Germany|German Communist Party]] and the [[Nazi Party]] controlled the majority of parliament, fuelled by discontent with the Weimar government. After a series of unsuccessful cabinets, President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] appointed [[Adolf Hitler]] as [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor of Germany]] on 30 January 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Fulbrook 1991, pp. 155?158, 172?177.&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 February 1933 the [[Reichstag fire|Reichstag]] building went up in flames, and a consequent [[Reichstag Fire Decree|emergency decree]] abrogated basic citizens' rights. An [[Enabling Act]] passed in parliament gave Hitler unrestricted legislative power. Only the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] voted against it, while [[KPD|Communist]] [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] had already been imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dhm.de/lemo/html/nazi/innenpolitik/ermaechtigungsgesetz/index.html |title=Das Erm?chtigungsgesetz 1933 |accessdate=25 March 2011 |publisher=[[Deutsches Historisches Museum]]|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Stackelberg| first =Roderick |year =1999 |title= Hitler's Germany: Origins, interpretations, legacies |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780415201155 |page =103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using his powers to crush any actual or potential resistance, Hitler established a centralised [[totalitarian state]] within months.

In 1935, Germany reacquired control of the [[Saar (League of Nations)|Saar]] and in 1936 military control of the [[Rhineland]], both of which had been lost in the Treaty of Versailles.&lt;ref&gt;Fulbrook 1991, pp. 188?189.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, [[Austria]] was [[Anschluss|annexed]], and in 1939, [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia]] was brought under German control. The [[invasion of Poland]] was prepared through the [[Molotov?Ribbentrop pact]] and [[Operation Himmler]]. On 1 September 1939 the German [[Wehrmacht]] launched a [[blitzkrieg]] on [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], which was swiftly occupied by Germany and by the Soviet [[Red Army]]. The UK and France declared war on Germany, marking the beginning of [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fulbrook 190&quot;&gt;Fulbrook 1991, pp. 190?195.&lt;/ref&gt; As the war progressed, Germany and its [[Axis powers|allies]] quickly gained control of most of [[Occupied Europe|continental Europe]] and [[North Africa]], though plans to [[Battle of Britain|force the United Kingdom]] to an armistice or surrender failed. On 22 June 1941, Germany broke the Molotov?Ribbentrop pact and [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]]. [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]'s [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] led Germany to declare war on the United States. The [[Battle of Stalingrad]] forced the German army to retreat on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern front]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fulbrook 190&quot;/&gt; In September 1943, Germany's ally Italy surrendered, and German troops were forced to defend an additional front in Italy.

The territories east of the [[Oder-Neisse line]], under Polish and Soviet ''de jure'' administration and ''de facto'' annexation, are shown as white as is the detached [[Saar (protectorate)|Saar protectorate]].]]
After the surrender of Germany, the remaining German territory and Berlin were partitioned by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] into four military occupation zones. The western sectors, controlled by France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, were merged on 23 May 1949 to form the ''[[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]]'' (''Bundesrepublik Deutschland''); on 7 October 1949, the Soviet Zone became the ''[[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]]'' (''Deutsche Demokratische Republik'', or DDR). They were informally known as &quot;West Germany&quot; and &quot;East Germany&quot;. East Germany selected East Berlin as its capital, while West Germany chose [[Bonn]] as a provisional capital,  to emphasise its stance that the two-state solution was an artificial and temporary ''status quo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wise | first = Michael Z. | title = Capital dilemma: Germany's search for a new architecture of democracy| year = 1998| publisher = Princeton Architectural Press | isbn =978-1-56898-134-5 | page = 23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

West Germany, established as a federal parliamentary republic with a &quot;[[social market economy]]&quot;, was allied with the United States, the UK and France. The country enjoyed prolonged economic growth beginning in the early 1950s ({{lang|de|''[[Wirtschaftswunder]]''}}). West Germany joined [[NATO]] in 1955 and was a founding member of the [[European Economic Community]] in 1957. East Germany was an [[Eastern bloc]] state under political and military control by the [[USSR]] via the latter's occupation forces and the [[Warsaw Pact]]. Though East Germany claimed to be a democracy, political power was exercised solely by leading members (''[[Politburo|Politb?ro]]'') of the communist-controlled [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] (SED), supported by the [[Stasi]], an immense secret service,&lt;ref name=&quot;spiegel_20080311&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,540771,00.html|title = New Study Finds More Stasi Spooks|author = maw/dpa|date = 11 March 2008|work = Spiegel Online ? english site (www.spiegel.de/international)|publisher = [[Der Spiegel]]|accessdate  = 30 October 2011|quote = 189,000 people were informers for the Stasi ? the former Communist secret police ? when East Germany collapsed in 1989 ? 15,000 more than previous studies had suggested.

Tensions between East and West Germany were reduced in the early 1970s by [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Willy Brandt]]'s {{lang|de|''[[Ostpolitik]]''}}. In summer 1989, Hungary decided to dismantle the [[Iron Curtain]] and open the borders, causing the emigration of thousands of [[East Germans]] to West Germany via Hungary. This had devastating effects on the [[East Germany|GDR]], where regular [[Monday demonstrations in East Germany|mass demonstrations]] received increasing support. The East German authorities unexpectedly eased the border restrictions, allowing East German citizens to travel to the West; originally intended to help retain East Germany as a state, the opening of the border actually led to an acceleration of the [[Die Wende|''Wende'' reform process]]. This culminated in the ''[[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany|Two Plus Four Treaty]]'' a year later on 12 September 1990, under which the four occupying powers renounced their rights under the [[German Instrument of Surrender|Instrument of Surrender]], and Germany regained full sovereignty. This permitted [[German reunification]] on 3 October 1990, with the accession of the five re-established states of the former GDR ([[New states of Germany|new states]] or &quot;neue L?nder&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;state&quot;/&gt;

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Germany}}
[[File:Deutschland topo.jpg|thumb|upright|150px|Topographic map]]

Germany is in Western and Central Europe, bordering [[Denmark]] in the north, [[Poland]] and the [[Czech Republic]] in the east, [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]] in the south, [[France]] and [[Luxembourg]] in the south-west, and [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]] in the north-west. It lies mostly between latitudes [[47th parallel north|47?]] and [[55th parallel north|55? N]] (the tip of [[Sylt]] is just north of 55?), and longitudes [[5th meridian east|5?]] and [[16th meridian east|16? E]]. The territory covers {{convert|357021|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, consisting of {{convert|349223|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} of land and {{convert|7798|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} of water. It is the seventh largest country by area in Europe and the [[List of countries by area|62nd largest in the world]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot;/&gt;

Elevation ranges from the mountains of the [[Alps]] (highest point: the [[Zugspitze]] at {{convert|2962|m|ft|0|disp=s}}) in the south to the shores of the [[North Sea]] (Nordsee) in the north-west and the [[Baltic Sea]] (Ostsee) in the north-east. The forested uplands of central Germany and the lowlands of northern Germany (lowest point: [[Wilstermarsch]] at {{convert|3.54|m|ft|1|disp=s}} below sea level) are traversed by such major rivers as the [[Rhine]], [[Danube]] and [[Elbe]].  Glaciers are found in the Alpine region, but are experiencing deglaciation. Significant natural resources are iron ore, coal, [[potash]], timber, [[lignite]], [[uranium]], copper, natural gas, salt, nickel, [[arable land]] and water.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gm.html| title = World Factbook | accessdate = 26 March 2011|publisher=CIA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
Most of Germany has a [[temperate|temperate seasonal climate]] in which humid westerly winds predominate. The climate is moderated by the [[North Atlantic Current|North Atlantic Drift]], the northern extension of the [[Gulf Stream]]. This warmer water affects the areas bordering the North Sea; consequently in the north-west and the north the climate is [[oceanic climate|oceanic]]. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Rainfall]] occurs year-round, especially in the summer. Winters are mild and summers tend to be cool, though temperatures can exceed {{convert|30|?C|?F|lk=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;climate&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate in Germany|url=http://www.germanculture.com.ua/library/facts/bl_climate.htm|publisher=GermanCulture|accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The east has a more [[continental climate]]; winters can be very cold and summers very warm, and long dry periods are frequent. Central and southern Germany are transition regions which vary from moderately oceanic to continental. In addition to the maritime and continental climates that predominate over most of the country, the Alpine regions in the extreme south and, to a lesser degree, some areas of the Central German Uplands have a mountain climate, characterised by lower temperatures and greater precipitation.&lt;ref name=&quot;climate&quot;/&gt;

===Biodiversity===
[[File:Aquila chrysaetos 3 (Martin Mecnarowski).jpg|thumb|The [[golden eagle|eagle]] is a protected bird of prey and the national [[heraldic animal]].]]
The territory of Germany can be subdivided into two [[ecoregion]]s: European-Mediterranean montane mixed forests and Northeast-Atlantic shelf marine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Terrestrial Ecoregions|url=http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/ecoregions/ecoregion_list/|publisher=WWF|accessdate=19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2008}} the majority of Germany is covered by either arable land (34%) or forest and [[woodland]] (30.1%); only 13.4% of the area consists of permanent pastures, 11.8% is covered by settlements and streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Strohm|first=Kathrin|url=http://www.agribenchmark.org/fileadmin/freefiles/ccc_2010/Poster_Germany.pdf|title=Arable farming in Germany|publisher=Agri benchmark|date=May 2010|accessdate=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plants and animals are those generally common to middle Europe. Beeches, oaks, and other deciduous trees constitute one third of the forests; conifers are increasing as a result of reforestation. Spruce and fir trees predominate in the upper mountains, while pine and larch are found in sandy soil. There are many species of ferns, flowers, fungi, and mosses. Wild animals include deer, wild boar, mouflon, fox, badger, hare, and small numbers of beavers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Bekker |first=Henk |title=Adventure Guide Germany |year=2005 |publisher=Hunter |isbn =9781588435033 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[List of national parks of Germany|national parks in Germany]] include the [[Wadden Sea National Parks]], the [[Jasmund National Park]], the [[Vorpommern Lagoon Area National Park]], the [[M?ritz National Park]], the [[Lower Oder Valley National Park]], the [[Harz National Park]], the [[Saxon Switzerland National Park]] and the [[Bavarian Forest National Park]]. More than 400 registered zoos and animal parks operate in Germany, which is believed to be the largest number in any country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Zoo Facts |url=http://www.americanzoos.info/Zoofacts.html |publisher=Zoos and Aquariums of America |accessdate=16 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Berlin Zoological Garden|Zoologische Garten Berlin]] is the oldest zoo in Germany and presents the most comprehensive collection of species in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zoo-berlin.de/zoo/unternehmen/historie.html|title=Der Zoologische Garten Berlin|publisher=Zoo Berlin|accessdate=19 March 2011|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Reichstag building Berlin view from west before sunset.jpg|thumb|left|270px|The [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag]] in Berlin is the site of the German parliament (Bundestag).]]

Germany is a [[federal republic|federal]], [[parliamentary democratic|parliamentary]], [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] republic. The German political system operates under a framework laid out in the 1949 constitutional document known as the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|''Grundgesetz'']] (Basic Law). Amendments generally require a two-thirds majority of both chambers of parliament; the fundamental principles of the constitution, as expressed in the articles guaranteeing human dignity, the separation of powers, the federal structure, and the rule of law are valid in perpetuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.btg-bestellservice.de/pdf/80201000.pdf|title=Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|date=October 2010|work=Deutscher Bundestag|publisher=Btg-bestellservice|accessdate=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[President of Germany|president]] is the [[head of state]] and invested primarily with representative responsibilities and powers. He is elected by the ''[[Bundesversammlung (Germany)|Bundesversammlung]]'' (federal convention), an institution consisting of the members of the ''Bundestag'' and an equal number of state delegates. The second-highest official in the [[German order of precedence]] is the ''Bundestagspr?sident'' ([[President of the Bundestag|President of the ''Bundestag'']]), who is elected by the ''Bundestag'' and responsible for overseeing the daily sessions of the body. The third-highest official and the [[head of government]] is the Chancellor, who is appointed by the ''Bundespr?sident'' after being elected by the ''Bundestag''.&lt;ref name=&quot;state&quot;/&gt;

[[File:2011 Joachim Gauck-2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Joachim Gauck]], President of Germany]]

The chancellor, currently [[Angela Merkel]], is the head of government and exercises [[executive (government)|executive power]], similar to the role of a Prime Minister in other parliamentary democracies. Federal [[legislative power]] is vested in the parliament consisting of the ''[[Bundestag]]'' (Federal Diet) and ''[[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]]'' (Federal Council), which together form the legislative body. The ''Bundestag'' is elected through [[direct election]]s, by [[proportional representation]] ([[mixed member proportional representation|mixed-member]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot;/&gt; The members of the ''Bundesrat'' represent the governments of the sixteen federated states and are members of the state cabinets.&lt;ref name=&quot;state&quot;/&gt;

Since 1949, the party system has been dominated by the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] with all chancellors hitherto being member of either party. However, the smaller liberal [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (which has had members in the ''Bundestag'' since 1949) and the [[Alliance '90/The Greens]] (which has controlled seats in parliament since 1983) have also played important roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/germany/159.htm|title=Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany has a [[civil law (legal system)|civil law system]] based on [[Roman law]] with some references to [[Germanic law]]. The ''[[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Bundesverfassungsgericht]]'' (Federal Constitutional Court) is the German Supreme Court responsible for constitutional matters, with power of [[judicial review]].&lt;ref name=&quot;state&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/en/index.html|title=Federal Constitutional Court|publisher=Bundesverfassungsgericht|accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany's supreme court system, called ''Oberste Gerichtsh?fe des Bundes'', is specialised: for civil and criminal cases, the highest court of appeal is the [[inquisitorial system|inquisitorial]] [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany|Federal Court of Justice]], and for other affairs the courts are the [[Federal Labor Court of Germany|Federal Labour Court]], the [[Bundessozialgericht|Federal Social Court]], the [[Federal Finance Court of Germany|Federal Finance Court]] and the [[Federal Administrative Court of Germany|Federal Administrative Court]].  The ''[[V?lkerstrafgesetzbuch]]'' regulates the consequences of [[crimes against humanity]], [[genocide]] and [[war crimes]], and gives German courts [[universal jurisdiction]] in some circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bundesrecht.juris.de/vstgb/BJNR225410002.html#BJNR225410002BJNG000200000|title=V?lkerstrafgesetz Teil 1 Allgemeine Regelungen|publisher=Bundesministerium der Justiz|accessdate=19 April 2011|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criminal and private laws are codified on the national level in the ''[[Strafgesetzbuch]]'' and the ''[[B?rgerliches Gesetzbuch]]'' respectively.

===Constituent states===
{{Main|States of Germany}}

Germany comprises [[States of Germany|sixteen states]] that are collectively referred to as ''L?nder''.&lt;ref&gt;The individual denomination is either ''Land'' [state], ''Freistaat'' [free state] or ''Freie (und) Hansestadt'' [free (and) Hanseatic city].&lt;br/&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bundesrat.de/nn_11006/EN/organisation-en/laender-en/laender-en-node.html?__nnn=true|title= The Federal States|publisher=[[Bundesrat of Germany]]|work = www.bundesrat.de|accessdate=17 July 2011}} &lt;br/&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/DE/Infoservice/Terminologie/Bundeslaender/Uebersicht_node.html|title = Amtliche Bezeichnung der Bundesl?nder|work = www.auswaertiges-amt.de|publisher = [[Foreign Office (Germany)|Federal Foreign Office]]|language = German|trans_title = Official denomination of federated states|format = PDF; download file ?Englisch?|accessdate = 22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Languages===

German is the official and predominant spoken language in Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eurobarometer Languages&quot;/&gt; It is one of 23 official languages in the European Union, and one of the three [[working language]]s of the [[European Commission]]. Recognised native minority languages in Germany are Danish, [[Low German]], [[Sorbian languages|Sorbian]], [[Romany language|Romany]], and [[Frisian languages|Frisian]]; they are officially protected by the [[ECRML]]. The most used immigrant languages are [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], Polish, the [[Balkan languages]], and Russian; 67% of German citizens claim to be able to communicate in at least one foreign language and 27% in at least two languages other than their own.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eurobarometer Languages&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Special Eurobarometer 243: Europeans and their Languages (Survey)|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |author=[[European Commission]]|year=2006|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_en.pdf| accessdate= 28 March 2011}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web|title=Special Eurobarometer 243: Europeans and their Languages (Executive Summary)|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |author=[[European Commission]]|year=2006|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_sum_en.pdf |accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Standard German is a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]] and is closely related to and classified alongside English, [[Low German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], and the Frisian languages. To a lesser extent, it is also related to the [[East Germanic languages|East]] (extinct) and [[North Germanic languages]]. Most German vocabulary is derived from the Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Many tongues, one family. Languages in the European Union|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |author=[[European Commission]] |year=2004|url=http://ec.europa.eu/publications/booklets/move/45/en.pdf |accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant minorities of words are derived from Latin and Greek, with a smaller amount from French and most recently English (known as [[Denglisch]]). German is written using the Latin alphabet. German [[dialect]]s, traditional local varieties traced back to the Germanic tribes, are distinguished from [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of [[standard German]] by their [[lexicon]], [[phonology]], and [[syntax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sprechen Sie Deutsch? |url=http://www.economist.com/node/15731354 |accessdate=16 April 2011 |newspaper=The Economist |date=18 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===

Since the 1960s, a reform movement attempted to unify secondary education in a ''Gesamtschule'' ([[comprehensive school]]); several West German states later simplified their school system to two or three tiers. A system of apprenticeship called ''Duale Ausbildung'' (&quot;dual education&quot;) allows pupils in [[vocational training]] to learn in a company as well as in a state-run vocational school.&lt;ref name=&quot;ED&quot;/&gt;

Optional [[kindergarten]] education is provided for all children between three and six years old, after which school attendance is [[compulsory education|compulsory]] for at least nine years.

The general entrance requirement for university is [[Abitur]], a qualification normally based on continuous assessment during the last few years at school and final examinations; however there are a number of exceptions, and precise requirements vary, depending on the state, the university and the subject.

From its roots, culture in Germany has been shaped by major intellectual and popular currents in Europe, both religious and [[secularism|secular]]. Historically Germany has been called ''Das Land der Dichter und Denker'' (the land of poets and thinkers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Wasser, Jeremy|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,410135,00.html|title=Sp?tzle Westerns|newspaper=Spiegel Online International|date=6 April 2006|accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The federated states are in charge of the cultural institutions.

Numerous German painters have enjoyed international prestige through their work in diverse artistic styles. [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], [[Matthias Gr?newald]], and [[Albrecht D?rer]] were important artists of the [[Renaissance]], [[Caspar David Friedrich]] of [[Romanticism]], and [[Max Ernst]] of [[Surrealism]]. Architectural contributions from Germany include the [[Carolingian architecture|Carolingian]] and [[Ottonian architecture|Ottonian styles]], which were precursors of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]]. The region later became the site of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] art. Germany was particularly important in the early [[modern architecture|modern movement]], especially through the [[Bauhaus]] movement founded by [[Walter Gropius]]. [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] became one of the world's most renowned architects in the second half of the 20th century. He conceived of the glass fa?ade skyscraper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=2006|title=A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=880|isbn=0-19-860678-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Grimm.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Brothers Grimm]]]]
[[German literature]] can be traced back to the Middle Ages and the works of writers such as [[Walther von der Vogelweide]] and [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]. Well-known German authors include [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] and [[Friedrich Schiller]]. The collections of folk tales published by the [[Brothers Grimm]] popularised [[German folklore]] on an international level. Influential authors of the 20th century include [[Thomas Mann]], [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[Hermann Hesse]], [[Heinrich B?ll]], and [[G?nter Grass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/articles/espmark/index.html |title=The Nobel Prize in Literature |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date=3 December 1999 |author=[[Kjell Espmark|Espmark, Kjell]] |accessdate= 28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; German-speaking book publishers produce some 700&amp;nbsp;million books every year, with about 80,000 titles, nearly 60,000 of them new.

German philosophy is historically significant. [[Gottfried Leibniz]]'s contributions to [[rationalism]]; the establishment of classical [[German idealism]] by [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]]; [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s composition of metaphysical pessimism; the formulation of [[communist theory]] by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]]; [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s development of [[perspectivism]]; [[Gottlob Frege]]'s contributions to the dawn of [[analytic philosophy]]; [[Martin Heidegger]]'s works on Being; and the development of the [[Frankfurt school]] by [[Max Horkheimer]], [[Theodor Adorno]], [[Herbert Marcuse]] and [[J?rgen Habermas]] have been particularly influential. In the 21st century Germany has contributed to the development of contemporary analytic philosophy in continental Europe, along with France, Austria, Switzerland and the Scandinavian countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Searle, John|year=1987|title=The Blackwell Companion to Philosophy|chapter=Introduction|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following opening paragraphs on this subject are a topic of great debate. Check the discussion page before editing. In particular, do ''not'' add mention of the territories to the first sentence: they are possessions of the United States, not part of it.

The '''United States of America''' (also called the '''United States''', the '''U.S.''', the '''USA''', '''America''', and the '''States''') is a [[federalism|federal]] [[constitutional republic]] comprising [[U.S. state|fifty states]] and a [[federal district]]. The country is situated mostly in central [[North America]], where its [[Contiguous United States|forty-eight contiguous states]] and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington,&amp;nbsp;D.C.]], the [[Capital districts and territories|capital district]], lie between the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] and [[Atlantic Ocean]]s, bordered by [[Canada]] to the north and [[Mexico]] to the south. The state of [[Alaska]] is in the northwest of the continent, with Canada to the east and [[Russia]] to the west, across the [[Bering Strait]]. The state of [[Hawaii]] is an [[archipelago]] in the mid-Pacific. The country also possesses [[Territories of the United States|several territories]] in the Pacific and [[Caribbean]].

At 3.79&amp;nbsp;million square miles (9.83&amp;nbsp;million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and with over 312 million people, the United States is the [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|third or fourth]] largest country by total area, and the third largest by both [[List of countries and outlying territories by land area|land area]] and [[List of countries by population|population]].

[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous peoples]] descended from [[Paleo-Indians|forebears]] who [[Settlement of the Americas|migrated from Asia]] have inhabited what is now the mainland United States for many thousands of years. This [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American population]] was greatly reduced by disease and warfare after [[European colonization of the Americas|European contact]]. The United States was founded by [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen British colonies]] located along the [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic seaboard]]. On July&amp;nbsp;4, 1776, they issued the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], which proclaimed their right to [[self-determination]] and their establishment of a cooperative union. The rebellious states defeated the [[British Empire]] in the [[American Revolutionary War|American Revolution]], the first successful [[History of colonialism|colonial war of independence]].&lt;ref&gt;Dull, Jonathan R.

ISBN 1-4051-1674-9.&lt;/ref&gt; The current [[United States Constitution]] was adopted on September&amp;nbsp;17, 1787; its ratification the following year made the states part of a single republic with a strong central government. The [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], comprising ten [[List of amendments to the United States Constitution|constitutional amendments]] guaranteeing many [[Natural and legal rights|fundamental civil rights and freedoms]], was ratified in 1791.

Through the 19th century, the United States displaced native tribes, acquired the [[Louisiana Purchase|Louisiana territory]] from France, [[Adams?On?s Treaty|Florida]] from Spain, part of the [[Oregon Country]] from the United Kingdom, [[Mexican Cession|Alta California and New Mexico]] from Mexico, and [[Alaska Purchase|Alaska]] from Russia, and annexed the [[Republic of Texas]] and the [[Republic of Hawaii]]. Disputes between the [[Southern United States|agrarian South]] and [[Northern United States|industrial North]] over the expansion of the [[slavery in the United States|institution of slavery]] and [[states' rights]] provoked the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] of the 1860s. The North's victory prevented a permanent split of the country and led to the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|end of legal slavery]] in the United States.

In 1507, German [[cartography|cartographer]] [[Martin Waldseem?ller]] produced a world map on which he named the lands of the Western Hemisphere [[Americas|&quot;America&quot;]] after Italian explorer and cartographer [[Amerigo Vespucci]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-04-24-america-turns-500_N.htm?csp=34|title=Cartographer Put 'America' on the Map 500 years Ago|work=USA Today|date=2007-04-24|accessdate=2008-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former British colonies first used the country's modern name in the 1776 [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], the &quot;unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America&quot;.&lt;!--Do not uppercase &quot;united&quot; here: it is unambiguously lowercased in the Declaration--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/charters.html|title=The Charters of Freedom|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=2007-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November&amp;nbsp;15, 1777, the [[Second Continental Congress]] adopted the [[Articles of Confederation]], which states, &quot;The Stile of this Confederacy shall be 'The United States of America'.&quot; The Franco-American treaties of 1778 used &quot;United States of North America&quot;, but from July&amp;nbsp;11, 1778, &quot;United States of America&quot; was used on the country's [[bills of exchange]], and it has been the official name ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=McClure, James|url=http://www.ydr.com/ci_9569289|title=A Primer: The 'First Capital' Debate|publisher=YDR.com|date=2008-06-12|accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The short form &quot;United States&quot; is also standard. Other common forms include the &quot;U.S.&quot;, the &quot;USA&quot;, and &quot;America&quot;. Colloquial names include the &quot;U.S. of A.&quot; and, internationally, the &quot;States&quot;. &quot;[[Columbia (name)|Columbia]]&quot;, a once popular name for the United States, derives from [[Christopher Columbus]]; it appears in the name &quot;[[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]&quot;.

The standard way to refer to a citizen of the United States is as an &quot;[[American (word)|American]]&quot;. Although &quot;United States&quot; is the official appositional term, &quot;American&quot; and &quot;U.S.&quot; are more commonly used to refer to the country adjectivally (&quot;American values&quot;, &quot;U.S.&amp;nbsp;forces&quot;). &quot;American&quot; is rarely used in English to refer to people not connected to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Kenneth G. (1993). ''The Columbia Guide to Standard American English''. New York: Columbia University Press, pp. 27?28. ISBN 0-231-06989-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase &quot;United States&quot; was originally treated as plural?e.g., &quot;the United States are&quot;?including in the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], ratified in 1865. It became common to treat it as singular?e.g., &quot;the United States is&quot;?after the end of the Civil War. The singular form is now standard; the plural form is retained in the idiom &quot;these United States&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002663.html|author=Zimmer, Benjamin|date=2005-11-24|title=Life in These, Uh, This United States|publisher=University of Pennsylvania?Language Log|accessdate=2008-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|Territorial evolution of the United States|United States territorial acquisitions}}
The United States is a [[federation|federal union]] of fifty states. The original thirteen states were the successors of the [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen colonies]] that rebelled against British rule. Early in the country's history, three new states were organized on territory separated from the claims of the existing states: [[Kentucky]] from [[Virginia]]; [[Tennessee]] from [[North Carolina]]; and [[Maine]] from [[Massachusetts]]. Most of the other states have been carved from territories obtained through war or purchase by the U.S. government. One set of exceptions comprises [[Vermont]], [[Texas]], and [[Hawaii]]: each was an independent republic before joining the union. During the [[American Civil War]], [[West Virginia]] broke away from Virginia. The most recent state?Hawaii?achieved statehood on August 21, 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/1999/10/18/special/story4.html | title=For Hawaii, At Long Last... | publisher=Honolulu Star-Bulletin | work=Honolulu Star-Bulletin | date=Oct. 18, 1999 | accessdate=February 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The states [[Texas v. White|do not have the right]] to [[secession|secede]] from the union.

The states compose the vast bulk of the U.S. land mass; the two other areas considered integral parts of the country are the District of Columbia, the [[federal district]] where the capital, Washington, is located; and [[Palmyra Atoll]], an uninhabited but [[territories of the United States|incorporated territory]] in the Pacific Ocean. The United States also possesses five major overseas territories: [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[United States Virgin Islands]] in the Caribbean; and [[American Samoa]], [[Guam]], and the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] in the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;See 8 U.S.C. ? 1101(a)(36) and 8 U.S.C. ? 1101(a)(38) U.S. Federal Code, Inmigration and Nationality Act.  {{USC|8|1101a}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Those born in the major territories (except for American Samoa) possess [[Birthright citizenship in the United States|U.S. citizenship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/RL30527.pdf| title = Presidential Elections in the United States: A Primer (Page 7)| accessdate = 2010-01-18| date = 2000-04-17| publisher = United States Congressional Research Service|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; American citizens residing in the territories have many of the same rights and responsibilities as citizens residing in the states; however, they are generally exempt from federal income tax, may not vote for president, and have only [[Delegate (United States Congress)|nonvoting representation in the U.S. Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;Raskin, James B.

In 1492, [[Genoa|Genoese]] explorer [[Christopher Columbus]], under contract to the Spanish crown, reached several Caribbean islands, making [[first contact (anthropology)|first contact]] with the indigenous people. On April&amp;nbsp;2, 1513, Spanish conquistador [[Juan Ponce de Le?n]] landed on what he called &quot;[[History of Florida|La Florida]]&quot;?the first documented European arrival on what would become the U.S. mainland. Spanish settlements in the region were followed by ones in the present-day [[southwestern United States]] that drew thousands through Mexico. French fur traders established outposts of [[New France]] around the [[Great Lakes]]; France eventually claimed much of the North American interior, down to the Gulf of Mexico. The first successful English settlements were the [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia Colony]] in [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] in 1607 and the [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]]' [[Plymouth Colony]] in 1620. The 1628 chartering of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] resulted in a wave of migration; by 1634, [[New England]] had been settled by some 10,000 [[Puritan]]s. Between the late 1610s and the American Revolution, about 50,000 convicts were shipped to Britain's American colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Butler|first= James Davie|work=American Historical Review 2|title=British Convicts Shipped to American Colonies|publisher=Smithsonian Institution, National Museum of Natural History|month=October|year=1896|accessdate=2007-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1614, the Dutch settled along the lower [[Hudson River]], including [[New Amsterdam]] on [[Manhattan|Manhattan Island]].

In 1674, the Dutch ceded their American territory to England; the province of [[New Netherland]] was renamed New York. Many new immigrants, especially to [[History of the Southern United States|the South]], were indentured servants?some two-thirds of all Virginia immigrants between 1630 and 1680.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, David Lee (2005). ''The American Revolution in the Southern Colonies''. Jefferson, N.C., and London: McFarland, p. 12. ISBN 0-7864-0783-2.&lt;/ref&gt; By the turn of the 18th century, [[Slavery in the colonial United States|African slaves]] were becoming the primary source of bonded labor. With the 1729 division of [[the Carolinas]] and the 1732 colonization of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], the [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen British colonies]] that would become the United States of America were established. All had local governments with elections open to most free men, with a growing devotion to the ancient [[rights of Englishmen]] and a sense of self-government stimulating support for republicanism. All legalized the [[African slave trade]]. With high birth rates, low death rates, and steady immigration, the colonial population grew rapidly. The [[Christian revival]]ist movement of the 1730s and 1740s known as the [[First Great Awakening|Great Awakening]] fueled interest in both religion and religious liberty. In the [[French and Indian War]], British forces seized Canada from the French, but the [[francophone]] population remained politically isolated from the southern colonies. Excluding the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] (popularly known as &quot;American Indians&quot;), who were being displaced, those thirteen colonies had a population of 2.6&amp;nbsp;million in 1770, about one-third that of Britain; nearly one in five Americans were black slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, Robin (1998).

ISBN 1-85984-195-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Though [[No taxation without representation|subject to British taxation]], the American colonials had no representation in the [[Parliament of Great Britain]].

===Independence and expansion===
[[File:Declaration independence.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Trumbull's Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]'', by [[John Trumbull]], 1817?18]]
Tensions between American colonials and the British during the [[American Revolution|revolutionary period]] of the 1760s and early 1770s led to the [[American Revolutionary War]], fought from 1775 to 1781. On June&amp;nbsp;14, 1775, the [[Second Continental Congress|Continental Congress]], convening in [[Philadelphia]], established a [[Continental Army]] under the command of [[George Washington]]. Proclaiming that &quot;[[all men are created equal]]&quot; and endowed with &quot;certain [[Natural and legal rights|unalienable Rights]]&quot;, the Congress adopted the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], drafted largely by [[Thomas Jefferson]], on July&amp;nbsp;4, 1776. That date is now celebrated annually as America's [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]]. In 1777, the [[Articles of Confederation]] established a weak [[confederation|confederal]] government that operated until 1789.

After the [[Siege of Yorktown|British defeat]] by American forces [[France in the American Revolutionary War|assisted by the French]] and [[Spain in the American Revolutionary War|Spanish]], Great Britain [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|recognized the independence of the United States]] and the states' sovereignty over American territory west to the [[Mississippi River]]. Those wishing to establish a strong federal government with powers of taxation organized a [[Philadelphia Convention|constitutional convention]] in 1787. The [[United States Constitution]] was ratified in 1788, and the new republic's [[1st United States Congress|first Senate, House of Representatives]], and [[President of the United States|president]]?George Washington?took office in 1789. The [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], forbidding federal restriction of [[Natural rights|personal freedoms and guaranteeing a range of legal protections]], was adopted in 1791.

Attitudes toward [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] were shifting; a [[Denied powers|clause in the Constitution]] protected the [[transatlantic slave trade]] only until 1808. The Northern states abolished slavery between 1780 and 1804, leaving the [[slave state]]s of the South as defenders of the &quot;[[peculiar institution]]&quot;. The [[Second Great Awakening]], beginning about 1800, made [[evangelicalism]] a force behind various social reform movements, including [[abolitionism]].

[[File:U.S. Territorial Acquisitions.png|thumb|Territorial acquisitions by date]]
Americans' eagerness to [[Territorial acquisitions of the United States|expand westward]] prompted a long series of [[American Indian Wars|Indian Wars]]. The [[Louisiana Purchase]] of French-claimed territory under President Thomas Jefferson in 1803 almost doubled the nation's size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Louisiana Purchase|url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/jeff/lewisclark2/circa1804/heritage/louisianapurchase/louisianapurchase.htm|work=National Parks Services|accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[War of 1812]], declared against Britain over various grievances and fought to a draw, strengthened U.S. nationalism. A series of U.S. military incursions into Florida led [[Adams?On?s Treaty|Spain to cede]] it and other Gulf Coast territory in 1819. The [[Trail of Tears]] in the 1830s exemplified the [[Indian removal]] policy that stripped the native peoples of their land. The United States annexed the [[Republic of Texas]] in 1845, amid a period when the concept of [[Manifest Destiny]] was becoming popular.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Michael A. (1999). ''Slavery and the American West: The Eclipse of Manifest Destiny and the Coming of the Civil War''. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, pp. 13?21. ISBN 0-8078-4796-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1846 [[Oregon Treaty]] with Britain led to U.S. control of the present-day [[Northwestern United States|American Northwest]]. The U.S. victory in the [[Mexican-American War]] resulted in the [[Mexican Cession|1848 cession]] of [[California]] and much of the present-day [[Southwestern United States|American Southwest]]. The [[California Gold Rush]] of 1848?49 further spurred western migration. [[Rail transport in the United States#History|New railways]] made relocation easier for settlers and increased conflicts with Native Americans. Over a half-century, up to 40 million [[American bison]], or buffalo, were slaughtered for skins and meat and to ease the railways' spread. The loss of the buffalo, a primary resource for the [[plains Indians]], was an existential blow to many native cultures.

===Civil War and industrialization===
[[File:Battle of Gettysburg, by Currier and Ives.png|thumb|left|''[[Battle of Gettysburg]]'', lithograph by [[Currier and Ives|Currier &amp; Ives]], ca. 1863]]
[[Origins of the American Civil War|Tensions]] between [[slave and free states]] mounted with arguments about the relationship between the [[states' rights|state and federal governments]], as well as [[Bleeding Kansas|violent conflicts]] over the spread of slavery into new states. [[Abraham Lincoln]], candidate of the largely antislavery [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], was elected president in 1860. Before he took office, seven slave states declared their secession?which the federal government maintained was illegal?and formed the [[Confederate States of America]]. With the Confederate [[Battle of Fort Sumter|attack upon Fort Sumter]], the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] began and four more slave states joined the Confederacy.

After the war, the [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln]] [[Radical Republicans|radicalized Republican]] [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] policies aimed at reintegrating and rebuilding the Southern states while ensuring the rights of the newly freed slaves. The resolution of the disputed [[United States presidential election, 1876|1876 presidential election]] by the [[Compromise of 1877]] ended Reconstruction; [[Jim Crow laws]] soon [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised many African Americans]]. In the North, urbanization and an unprecedented [[Immigration to the United States#History|influx of immigrants]] from Southern and Eastern Europe hastened the [[United States technological and industrial history#Technological systems and infrastructure|country's industrialization]]. The wave of immigration, lasting until 1929, provided labor and transformed American culture. National infrastructure development spurred economic growth. The 1867 [[Alaska Purchase]] from Russia completed the country's mainland expansion. The [[Wounded Knee Massacre]] in 1890 was the last major armed conflict of the Indian Wars. In 1893, the [[Ancient Hawaii|indigenous monarchy]] of the Pacific [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] was overthrown in a coup led by American residents; the United States annexed the archipelago in 1898. Victory in the [[Spanish?American War]] the same year demonstrated that the United States was a [[Great power|world power]] and led to the annexation of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gates, John M.|url=http://www3.wooster.edu/History/jgates/book-ch3.html|title=War-Related Deaths in the Philippines|work=Pacific Historical Review|publisher=College of Wooster|date=August 1984|accessdate=2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Philippines gained independence a half-century later; Puerto Rico and Guam remain U.S. territories.

===Cold War and protest politics===
[[File:Martin Luther King&amp;nbsp;- March on Washington.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] delivering his &quot;[[I Have a Dream]]&quot; speech, 1963]]
The United States and Soviet Union jockeyed for power after World War II during the [[Cold War]], dominating the military affairs of Europe through [[NATO]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]], respectively. While they engaged in [[proxy war]]s and developed powerful nuclear arsenals, the two countries avoided direct military conflict. Resisting leftist land and income redistribution projects around the world, the United States often supported authoritarian governments. American troops fought [[People's Republic of China|Communist Chinese]] forces in the [[Korean War]] of 1950?53. The [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] pursued a series of investigations into suspected leftist subversion, while Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] became the figurehead of anticommunist sentiment.

The 1961 Soviet launch of the [[Vostok 1|first manned spaceflight]] prompted President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s call for the United States to be first to land [[Apollo program|&quot;a man on the moon&quot;]], achieved in 1969. Kennedy also faced a [[Cuban Missile Crisis|tense nuclear showdown]] with Soviet forces in Cuba. Meanwhile, the United States experienced sustained economic expansion. A growing [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955?1968)|civil rights movement]], symbolized and led by African Americans such as [[Rosa Parks]] and [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], used [[nonviolence]] to confront segregation and discrimination. Following [[John F. Kennedy assassination|Kennedy's assassination]] in 1963, the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and [[Voting Rights Act|Voting Rights Act of 1965]] were passed under President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;Dallek, Robert (2004), ''Lyndon B. Johnson: Portrait of a President'', p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=old&amp;doc=97 |title=Our Documents&amp;nbsp;?

A widespread [[counterculture of the 1960s|countercultural movement]] grew, fueled by [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|opposition to the war]], [[black nationalism]], and the [[sexual revolution]]. [[Betty Friedan]], [[Gloria Steinem]], and others led a [[Feminism in the United States|new wave of feminism]] that sought political, social, and economic equality for women.

As a result of the [[Watergate scandal]], in 1974 Nixon became the first U.S. president to resign, to avoid being [[impeachment|impeached]] on charges including obstruction of justice and abuse of power. The [[Jimmy Carter]] administration of the late 1970s was marked by [[stagflation]] and the [[Iran hostage crisis]]. The election of [[Ronald Reagan]] as president in 1980 heralded a [[Conservatism in the United States|rightward shift in American politics]], reflected in major changes in [[Reaganomics|taxation and spending priorities]]. His second term in office brought both the [[Iran?Contra affair|Iran-Contra scandal]] and significant [[Cold War (1985?1991)|diplomatic progress with the Soviet Union]]. The subsequent Soviet collapse ended the Cold War.

===Contemporary era===
[[File:UA Flight 175 hits WTC south tower 9-11 edit.jpeg|thumb|The [[World Trade Center]] on the morning of [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]]]]

On [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]], [[al-Qaeda]] terrorists struck the [[World Trade Center]] in New York City and [[The Pentagon]] near Washington, D.C., killing nearly three thousand people. In response, the [[Presidency of George W.

In almost all cases, executive and legislative officials are elected by a [[plurality voting system|plurality vote]] of citizens by district. There is no [[proportional representation]] at the federal level, and it is very rare at lower levels.

[[File:WhiteHouseSouthFacade.JPG|thumb|left|The south fa?ade of the [[White House]], home and workplace of the [[President of the United States|U.S. president]]]]
The federal government is composed of three branches:
* [[Legislature|Legislative]]: The [[bicameralism|bicameral]] [[United States Congress|Congress]], made up of the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], makes [[federal law]], [[declaration of war|declares war]], approves treaties, has the [[power of the purse]], and has the power of [[impeachment]], by which it can remove sitting members of the government.
* [[Executive (government)|Executive]]: The [[President of the United States|president]] is the [[commander-in-chief]] of the military, can veto [[bill (proposed law)|legislative bills]] before they become law, and appoints the [[United States Cabinet|members of the Cabinet]] (subject to Senate approval) and other officers, who administer and enforce federal laws and policies.
* [[Judiciary|Judicial]]: The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] and lower [[United States federal courts|federal courts]], whose judges are appointed by the president with Senate approval, interpret laws and overturn those they find [[constitutionality|unconstitutional]].

[[File:USSupremeCourtWestFacade.JPG|thumb|The west front of the [[United States Supreme Court Building]]]]
The House of Representatives has 435 voting members, each representing a [[congressional district]] for a two-year term. House seats are [[United States congressional apportionment|apportioned]] among the states by population every tenth year. As of the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 census]], seven states have the minimum of one representative, while California, the most populous state, has fifty-three. The Senate has 100 members with each state having two senators, elected [[at-large]] to six-year terms; one third of Senate seats are up for election every other year. The president serves a four-year term and may be elected to the office [[Term limits in the United States|no more than twice]]. The president is [[United States presidential election|not elected by direct vote]], but by an indirect [[United States Electoral College|electoral college]] system in which the determining votes are apportioned to the states and the [[District of Columbia]]. The Supreme Court, led by the [[Chief Justice of the United States]], has nine members, who serve for life.

The state governments are structured in roughly similar fashion; [[Nebraska]] uniquely has a [[unicameral]] legislature. The [[Governor (United States)|governor]] (chief executive) of each state is directly elected. Some state judges and cabinet officers are appointed by the governors of the respective states, while others are elected by popular vote.

The original text of the Constitution establishes the structure and responsibilities of the federal government and its relationship with the individual states. [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article One]] protects the right to the &quot;great writ&quot; of [[Habeas corpus in the United States|habeas corpus]], and [[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article Three]] guarantees the [[Jury trial#United States|right to a jury trial]] in all criminal cases. [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Amendments to the Constitution]] require the approval of three-fourths of the states. The Constitution has been amended twenty-seven times; the first ten amendments, which make up the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], and the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] form the central basis of Americans' individual rights. All laws and governmental procedures are subject to [[judicial review]] and any law ruled in violation of the Constitution is voided. The principle of judicial review, not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, was declared by the Supreme Court in ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'' (1803).

The United States has been a leader in scientific research and technological innovation since the late 19th century. In 1876, [[Alexander Graham Bell]] was awarded the first U.S. [[Invention of the telephone|patent for the telephone]]. [[Thomas Edison]]'s laboratory developed the [[phonograph]], the first [[Incandescent light bulb|long-lasting light bulb]], and the first viable [[Kinetoscope|movie camera]]. [[Nikola Tesla]] pioneered [[alternating current]], the [[AC motor]], and radio. In the early 20th century, the automobile companies of [[Ransom E. Olds]] and [[Henry Ford]] popularized the [[assembly line]]. The [[Wright brothers]], in 1903, made the [[Wright Flyer|first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Benedetti, Fran?ois| url =http://www.fai.org/news_archives/fai/000295.asp| archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20070912065254/http://www.fai.org/news_archives/fai/000295.asp| archivedate =2007-09-12| title =100 Years Ago, the Dream of Icarus Became Reality| publisher =F?d?ration A?ronautique Internationale (FAI)|date=2003-12-17|accessdate=2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of [[Nazism]] in the 1930s led many European scientists, including [[Albert Einstein]], [[Enrico Fermi]], and [[John von Neumann]], to immigrate to the United States. During World War II, the [[Manhattan Project]] developed nuclear weapons, ushering in the [[Atomic Age]]. The [[Space Race]] produced rapid advances in rocketry, [[materials science]], and computers. [[IBM]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]], and [[Microsoft]] refined and popularized the [[personal computer]]. The United States largely developed the [[ARPANET]] and its successor, the [[Internet]].

[[File:Ford Crown Victoria 1.JPG|thumb|left|240px|Law enforcement in the U.S. is maintained primarily by local police departments.

Law enforcement in the United States is primarily the responsibility of local police and [[sheriff]]'s departments, with [[state police]] providing broader services. Federal agencies such as the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and the [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshals Service]] have specialized duties. At the federal level and in almost every state, jurisprudence operates on a [[common law]] system. State courts conduct most criminal trials; [[United States federal courts|federal courts]] handle certain designated crimes as well as certain appeals from the state systems. [[Controlled Substances Act|Federal law]] prohibits a variety of drugs, although states sometimes [[Legal history of cannabis in the United States#Attempts to decriminalize (1970s?2000s)|pass laws]] in conflict with federal regulations. The [[Smoking age#United States|smoking age]] is generally 18, and the [[Legal drinking age#Americas|drinking age]] is generally 21.

In the 18th and early 19th centuries, American art and literature took most of its cues from Europe. Writers such as [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], and [[Henry David Thoreau]] established a distinctive American literary voice by the middle of the 19th century. [[Mark Twain]] and poet [[Walt Whitman]] were major figures in the century's second half; [[Emily Dickinson]], virtually unknown during her lifetime, is now recognized as an essential American poet.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Bloom|Bloom, Harold]]. 1999.

The [[Beat Generation]] writers opened up new literary approaches, as have [[postmodern literature|postmodernist]] authors such as [[John Barth]], [[Thomas Pynchon]], and [[Don DeLillo]].

The [[transcendentalism|transcendentalists]], led by Thoreau and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], established the first major [[American philosophy|American philosophical movement]]. After the Civil War, [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and then [[William James]] and [[John Dewey]] were leaders in the development of [[pragmatism]]. In the 20th century, the work of [[W. V.

[[John Rawls]] and [[Robert Nozick]] led a revival of [[political philosophy]].

In the visual arts, the [[Hudson River School]] was a mid-19th-century movement in the tradition of European [[naturalism (arts)|naturalism]].

Major artistic movements such as the [[abstract expressionism]] of [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]] and the [[pop art]] of [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] developed largely in the United States.

One of the first major promoters of [[Theater of the United States|American theater]] was impresario [[P. T. Barnum]], who began operating a lower [[Manhattan]] entertainment complex in 1841. The team of [[Edward Harrigan|Harrigan and Hart]] produced a series of popular [[musical theatre|musical]] comedies in New York starting in the late 1870s. In the 20th century, the modern musical form emerged on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]; the songs of musical theater composers such as [[Irving Berlin]], [[Cole Porter]], and [[Stephen Sondheim]] have become [[Traditional pop music|pop standards]]. Playwright [[Eugene O'Neill]] won the Nobel literature prize in 1936; other acclaimed U.S. dramatists include multiple [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama|Pulitzer Prize]] winners [[Tennessee Williams]], [[Edward Albee]], and [[August Wilson]].

Though little known at the time, [[Charles Ives]]'s work of the 1910s established him as the first major U.S. composer in the classical tradition, while experimentalists such as [[Henry Cowell]] and [[John Cage]] created a distinctive American approach to classical composition. [[Aaron Copland]] and [[George Gershwin]] developed a new synthesis of popular and classical music. [[Choreography|Choreographers]] [[Isadora Duncan]] and [[Martha Graham]] helped create [[modern dance]], while [[George Balanchine]] and [[Jerome Robbins]] were leaders in 20th century ballet. Americans have long been important in the modern artistic medium of [[photography]], with major photographers including [[Alfred Stieglitz]], [[Edward Steichen]], and [[Ansel Adams]].

===Food===
{{Main|American cuisine}}
Mainstream American cuisine is similar to that in other Western countries. Wheat is the primary cereal grain. Traditional American cuisine uses indigenous ingredients, such as turkey, venison, potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup, which were consumed by Native Americans and early European settlers. Slow-cooked pork and beef barbecue, crab cakes, potato chips, and chocolate chip cookies are distinctively American foods. [[Soul food]], developed by African slaves, is popular around the South and among many African Americans elsewhere. [[Syncretism|Syncretic]] cuisines such as [[Louisiana Creole cuisine|Louisiana creole]], [[Cajun cuisine|Cajun]], and [[Tex-Mex]] are regionally important.

Characteristic dishes such as apple pie, fried chicken, pizza, hamburgers, and hot dogs derive from the recipes of various immigrants. French fries, Mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos, and pasta dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are widely consumed.&lt;ref name=&quot;IFT&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newswise.com/articles/what-when-and-where-americans-eat-in-2003|author=Klapthor, James N. |title=What, When, and Where Americans Eat in 2003 |publisher=Newswise/Institute of Food Technologists |date=2003-08-23|accessdate=2007-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Americans generally prefer coffee to tea.

Philosophy of war

<text>
{{Refimprove|date=August 2011}}The '''philosophy of war''' examines [[war]] beyond the typical questions of [[weapon|weaponry]] and [[Military Strategy|strategy]], inquiring into such things as the meaning and [[etiology]] of war, the relationship between war and human nature, and the [[ethics]] of war. Certain aspects of the philosophy of war may overlap with the [[philosophy of history]], [[political philosophy]] and the [[philosophy of law]].
==Works about the philosophy of war==
[[Image:Clausewitz.jpg|thumb|Carl von Clausewitz, painting by [[Karl Wilhelm Wach]].]]Perhaps the greatest and most influential work in the [[philosophy]] of war is ''[[On War]]'' by [[Carl von Clausewitz]]. It combines observations on strategy with questions about [[human nature]] and the purpose of war. Clausewitz especially examines the [[teleology]] of war: whether war is a means to an end outside itself or whether it can be an end in itself. He concludes that the latter cannot be so, and that war is &quot;[[politics]] by different means&quot;; i.e. that war must not exist only for its own sake. It must serve some purpose for the state.

[[Leo Tolstoy]]'s novel ''[[War and Peace]]'' contains frequent philosophical digressions on the philosophy of war (and broader [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] speculations derived from [[Christianity]] and from Tolstoy's observations of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]). It was influential on later thought about war. Tolstoy's [[Christian]]-centered philosophy of war (especially his essays &quot;[[A Letter to a Hindu]]&quot; and &quot;[[The Kingdom of God is Within You]]&quot;) was a direct influence on [[Gandhi]]'s [[Hinduism]]-centered [[non-violent resistance]] philosophy.

While [[Sun Tzu|Sun Tzu's]] ''[[The Art of War]]'', focusses mostly on weaponry and strategy instead of philosophy, his observations are often broadened into a philosophy applied in situations extending well beyond war itself (see the main Wikipedia article on ''The Art of War'' for a discussion of the application of Sun Tzu's philosophy to areas other than war). Parts of [[Niccol? Machiavelli|Niccol? Machiavelli's]] masterpiece ''[[The Prince]]'' (as well as ''[[Discourses on Livy|Discourses]]'') and parts of his own work titled ''The Art of War'' discuss some philosophical points relating to war, though neither book could be said to be a work in the philosophy of war

==Traditions of thought==

Since the philosophy of war is often treated as a subset of another branch of philosophy (for example, political philosophy or the philosophy of law) it would be difficult to define any clear-cut schools of thought in the same sense that, e.g., [[Existentialism]] or [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] can be described as distinct movements. The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy refers to Carl von Clausewitz is &quot;the only (so-called) philosopher of war&quot;, implying that he is the only (major) philosophical writer who develops a philosophical system focusing ''exclusively'' on war. However, discernible traditions of thought on war have developed over time, so that some writers have been able to distinguish broad categories (if somewhat loosely).

===Teleological categories===
[[Anatol Rapoport]]'s introduction to his edition of the [[J. J. Graham]] [[translation]] of Clausewitz's ''On War'' identifies three main teleological traditions in the philosophy of war: the cataclysmic, the [[eschatology|eschatological]], and the political. (''On War'', Rapoport's introduction, 13). These are not the only possible teleological philosophies of war, but only three of the most common. As Rapoport says,

::''To put it [[metaphor]]ically, in political philosophy war is compared to a game of strategy (like [[chess]]); in eschatological philosophy, to a mission or the d?nouement of a [[drama]]; in cataclysmic philosophy, to a [[fire]] or an [[epidemic]].''

::''These do not, of course, exhaust the views of war prevailing at different times and at different places. For example, war has at times been viewed as a pastime or an [[adventure]], as the only proper occupation for a [[nobleman]], as an affair of [[honor]] (for example, the days of [[chivalry]]), as a [[ceremony]] (e.g. among the [[Aztecs]]), as an outlet of aggressive [[instinct]]s or a manifestation of a &quot;[[deathwish|death wish]]&quot;, as [[nature]]'s way of ensuring the [[survival of the fittest]], as an [[absurdity]] (e.g. among [[Eskimos]]), as a tenacious custom, destined to die out like [[slavery]], and as a [[crime]].'' (''On War'', Rapoport's introduction, 17)

*The '''Cataclysmic''' school of thought, which was espoused by [[Leo Tolstoy]] in his epic novel ''[[War and Peace]]'', sees war as a bane on humanity ? whether avoidable or inevitable ? which serves little purpose outside of causing destruction and suffering, and which may cause drastic change to [[society]], but not in any teleological sense. Tolstoy's view may be placed under the subcategory of global cataclysmic philosophy of war.  Another subcategory of the cataclysmic school of thought is the [[ethnocentric]] cataclysmic, in which this view is focused specifically on the plight of a specific [[ethnicity]] or [[nation]], for example the view in [[Judaism]] of war as a [[punishment]] from [[God]] on the [[Israelites]] in certain books of the [[Tanakh|Tenakh]] ([[Old Testament]]). As the Tenakh (in certain books) sees war as an ineluctable act of God, so Tolstoy especially emphasizes war as something that befalls man and is in no way under the influence of man's &quot;[[free will]]&quot;, but is instead the result of irresistible global forces. (''On War'', Rapoport's introduction 16)

*The '''Eschatological''' school of thought sees all wars (or all major wars) as leading to some goal, and asserts that some final conflict will someday resolve the path followed by all wars and result in a massive upheaval of society and a subsequent new society free from war (in varying theories the resulting society may be either a [[utopia]] or a [[dystopia]]). There are two subsets of this view: the Messianic and the Global theory. The [[Marxist]] concept of a [[communist]] world ruled by the [[proletariat]] after a final worldwide [[revolution]] is an example of the global theory, and the [[Christian]] concept of an [[Armageddon]] war which will usher in the [[second coming]] of [[Christ]] and the final defeat of [[Satan]] is an example of a theory that could fall under Global or Messianic. (''On War'', Rapoport's introduction, 15) The [[messiah|messianic]] eschatological philosophy is derived from the Jewish-Christian concept of a [[Messiah]], and sees wars as culminating in unification of humanity under a single [[faith]] or a single ruler. [[Crusades]], [[Jihad]]s, the [[Nazi]] concept of a [[Master Race]] and the 19th century American concept of [[Manifest Destiny]] may also fall under this heading. (''On War'', Rapoport's introduction, 15) (See main articles for more information: [[Christian eschatology]], [[Jewish eschatology]])

*The '''Political''' school of thought, of which Clausewitz was a proponent, sees war as a tool of the [[Sovereign state|state]]. On page 13 Rapoport says,

::''Clausewitz views war as a rational instrument of national [[policy]]. The three words &quot;[[Rationality|rational]]&quot;, &quot;[[Tool|instrument]]&quot; and &quot;national&quot; are the key concepts of his paradigm. In this view, the decision to wage war &quot;ought&quot; to be rational, in the sense that it ought to be based on estimated costs and gains of war. Next, war &quot;ought&quot; to be instrumental, in the sense that it ought to be waged in order to achieve some goal, never for its own sake; and also in the sense that strategy and tactics ought to be directed towards just one end, namely towards victory. Finally, war &quot;ought&quot; to be national, in the sense that its objective should be to advance the interests of a national state and that the entire effort of the nation ought to be mobilized in the service of the military objective.''

:He later characterizes the philosophy behind the [[Vietnam War]] and other [[Cold War]] conflicts as &quot;Neo-Clausewitzian&quot;. Rapoport also includes Machiavelli as an early example of the political philosophy of war (''On War'', Rapoport's introduction, 13). Decades after his essay, the [[War on Terrorism]] and the [[Operation Iraqi Freedom|Iraq War]] begun by the [[United States]] under President [[George W. Bush]] in 2001 and 2003 have often been justified under the [[doctrine of preemption]], a political motivation stating that the United States must use war to prevent further attacks such as the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].

===Ethical categories===
Another possible system for categorizing different schools of thought on war can be found in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (see external links, below), based on [[ethics]]. The SEP describes three major divisions in the ethics of war: the Realist, the Pacifist, and the Just War Theory. In a nutshell:

* '''Realists''' will typically hold that systems of [[morals]] and ethics which guide ''individuals'' within societies cannot realistically be applied to societies as a whole to govern the way they, as societies, interact with other societies. Hence, a state's purposes in war is simply to preserve its national interest. This kind of thinking is similar to Machiavelli's philosophy, and [[Thucydides]] and [[Hobbes]] may also fall under this category.

* '''[[pacifism|Pacifists]]''', however, maintain that a moral evaluation of war is possible, and that war is always found to be immoral. [[Gandhi]], [[Martin Luther King]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]] were all famous advocates of pacifistic [[nonviolent resistance]] methods instead of war.

* '''[[Just War Theory]]''', along with pacifism, holds that morals do apply to war. However, unlike pacifism, according to Just War Theory it ''is'' possible for a war to be morally justified. The concept of a morally justified war underlies much of the concept [[International Law]], such as the [[Geneva Conventions]]. [[Aristotle]], [[Cicero]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[Aquinas]], and [[Hugo Grotius]] are among the philosophers who have espoused some form of a just war philosophy. One common Just War Theory evaluation of war is that war is only justified if 1.) waged in a state or nation's self-defense, or 2.) waged in order to end gross violations of [[human rights]]. Political philosopher John Rawls advocated these criteria as justification for war.

{{Other uses|Theatre of War (disambiguation)}}{{History of war}}In [[war]]fare, a '''theater''', is defined as an area or place within which important military events occur or are progressing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/theatre_4 |title=Definition of theatre noun (MILITARY) from Cambridge Dictionary Online: Free English Dictionary and Thesaurus |publisher=Dictionary.cambridge.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Theater+(warfare) |title=Theater (warfare) - definition of Theater (warfare) by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entirety of the air, land, and sea area that is or that may potentially become involved  in war operations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wordwebonline.com/en/THEATREOFWAR&lt;/ref&gt;

In a technical sense, a theater as described here, is defined as being a type of ''locus''.&lt;ref&gt;http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/locus&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theater of war==
The term seems to have been coined by [[Carl von Clausewitz]] in his book &quot;[[On War]]&quot;.
Clausewitz defines the term as one that: &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Denotes properly such a portion of the space over which war prevails as has its boundaries protected, and thus possesses a kind of independence. This protection may consist in fortresses, or important natural obstacles presented by the country, or even in its being separated by a considerable distance from the rest of the space embraced in the war. Such a portion is not a mere piece of the whole, but a small whole complete in itself; and consequently it is more or less in such a condition that changes which take place at other points in the seat of war have only an indirect and no direct influence upon it. To give an adequate idea of this, we may suppose that on this portion an advance is made, whilst in another quarter a retreat is taking place, or that upon the one an army is acting defensively, whilst an offensive is being carried on upon the other. Such a clearly defined idea as this is not capable of universal application; it is here used merely to indicate the line of distinction.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clausewitz.com/CWZHOME/VomKriege2/ONWARTOC2.HTML |title=Carl Von Clausewitz, On War |publisher=Clausewitz.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Theater of operations==
''Theater of operations'' (TO)  is instead a sub-area existing within a  theater of war, the boundaries of this being defined by the commander who is orchestrating or providing support for specific [[combat operations]] within that location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Theater+(warfare) |title=Theater (warfare) - definition of Theater (warfare) by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soviet and Russian Armed Forces==
For example a large geographic subdivision used by the [[Soviet Armed Forces|Soviet]] and [[Armed Forces of the Russian Federation|Russian Armed Forces]] to classify the continental geographic territories with their bordering maritime areas, islands, adjacent coasts&lt;ref&gt;See ??????? ????????????????? ??????? (???), ?????? (?.), ??????? ???????????? (??), 1984 ??? (?.), 863 ??????? (???). ? ????????????? (??.), 30 ?????? (??.), ???. 732;&lt;/ref&gt; and airspace. The division of large continental and maritime areas assists in determining the limits within which the plans for operation of strategic military groups of forces are developed, allowing conduct of [[military operation]]s on specific significant [[strategic direction]]s.
The Russian term is {{lang|ru|????? ??????? ????????}}, ''teatr voennykh deistvii'', abbreviated {{lang|ru|???}}, ''TVD''.

==United States==
The term &quot;theater of operations&quot; was defined in the [American] field manuals as the land and sea areas to be invaded or defended, including areas necessary for administrative activities incident to the military operations (chart 12). In accordance with the experience of [[World War I]], it was usually conceived of as a large land mass over which continuous operations would take place and was divided into two chief areas-the combat zone, or the area of active fighting, and the communications zone, or area required for administration of the theater. As the armies advanced, both these zones and the areas into which they were divided would shift forward to new geographic areas of control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/wwii/orgadmin/org_admin_wwii_chpt7.htm |title=Chapter VII: Prewar Army Doctrine for Theater |publisher=History.amedd.army.mil |date= |accessdate=2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Merge|Loss Exchange Ratio|date=October 2010}}{{Unreferenced|date=January 2009}}
'''Loss exchange ratio''' is a [[figure of merit]] in [[attrition warfare]]. It is usually relevant to a condition or state of war where one side depletes the resources of another through attrition. Specifically and most often used as a comparator in aerial combat, where it is known as a &quot;kill-ratio.&quot; For example, during the [[Korean War]], American combat jets had a kill-ratio of 12-1 and often higher (stated as twelve to one). This means for every twelve aircraft shot down by an American aircraft, one American plane was shot down by an enemy fighter. It was a rather good ratio for the Americans, especially when compared to some loss rates of 1-1.1 encountered by American fighter aircraft during much of the air war over southeast Asia{{Fact|date=January 2009}}. This loss rate of nearly one to one was a further setback for the American forces when considering the more sophisticated American aircraft were many times more expensive than their Soviet built counterparts. This Loss exchange ratio was the impetus for American forces to resurvey and retrain their pilots in programs such as [[United States Navy Fighter Weapons School|TOPGUN]].

<text>
The '''Human Security Report Project''' ('''HSRP''') is a [[Peace and Conflict Studies]] research group. Based at [[Canada]]'s [[Simon Fraser University]]'s [[School for International Studies]] at [[Harbour Centre]] in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]&lt;ref&gt;Human Security Report Project: [http://www.hsrgroup.org/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=342&amp;Itemid=68 About the Project] (accessed March 23, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; It was formerly based at the [[University of British Columbia]]'s [[Liu Institute for Global Issues]] in the [http://www.ligi.ubc.ca/page165.htm Human Security Centre].[[Image:HSRP Logo.png|thumb|Human Security Report Project (HSRP)]]== Publications and Services ==
The Project is known primarily for the [[Human Security Report 2005]] that provided evidence that according to the Project's data and definitions, there had been a large decline in the number of [[wars]], [[genocides]] and international crises since the end of the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;Human Security Report 2005:  [http://www.humansecurityreport.org/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=34&amp;Itemid=69 The HSR In the News] (accessed May 25, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Human Security Report 2005: [http://www.humansecurityreport.info/HSR2005_PDF/Overview.pdf Overview] (accessed March 22, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Project adopts the 'narrow' conception of [[Human Security]]. The distinction between the 'narrow' and 'broad' concepts of Human Security, is summarized [[Human security#Freedom from Fear vs Freedom from Want and beyond|here]] on the Human Security page.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the Project published the [[Human Security Brief 2006]] that updated the core global trend data from the 2005 Report and the [[Human Security Brief 2007]]. The 2007 Brief demonstrated that there had been a sharp decline in the incidence of [[terrorist]] violence (measured in terms of numbers of fatalities) around the world.  If fatalities from political violence against civilians perpetrated by non-state groups in Iraq are counted as deaths from terrorism the decline dated mid-2007. This claim was disputed in a press release from the University of Maryland's, START consortium .&lt;ref&gt;Human Security Brief 2007: [http://www.humansecuritybrief.info/hsb07_chapter1.pdf Chapter 1- Dying to Lose: Explaining the Decline in Global Terrorism] (accessed March 22, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;University of Maryland Newsdesk: [http://www.newsdesk.umd.edu/sociss/release.cfm?ArticleID=1667 Terrorism Fatalities Up, Not Down UMD Analysis Disputes New Report] (accessed March 22, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; However, START at that time only had incident data to 2004. Subsequent START reports confirmed the large decline in fatalities from terrorism in 2007. One problem with the START project's dataset is that it counts politically motivated killings of civilians in civil war by non-state actors as terrorism in some contexts, but not in others.  In Iraq, for example, such killings are counted as acts of terrorism, but the very large number of comparable killings in sub-Saharan Africa's civil wars in the 1990s are not. Subsequent to the publication of the 2007 Brief the incidence of global terrorism has again increased with most of the increase being in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Further the 2007 Brief suggested positive change in [[sub-Saharan Africa]]'s security landscape; the number of [[War|conflicts]] being waged in the region more than halved between [[1999]] and [[2006]].&lt;ref&gt;Human Security Brief 2007: [http://www.humansecuritybrief.info/hsb07_chapter2.pdf Chapter 2- Towards A New Peace in Africa?] (accessed March 22, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

In late October 2008, the Project published-in conjunction with the [[World Bank]], the [[miniAtlas of Human Security]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miniatlasofhumansecurity.info/en/ miniAtlas of Human Security] (accessed March 22, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; This publication was produced in three languages and is an &quot;at-a-glance guide to global security issues&quot; using a selection of maps and graphics to illustrate security trends, and is part of the World Bank's miniAtlas series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miniatlasofhumansecurity.info/en/ miniAtlas of Human Security] (accessed March 22, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://publications.worldbank.org/ecommerce/catalog/simple-search?has_results_p=1&amp;search_type_to_pass=title&amp;search_text=miniAtlas World Bank miniAtlas Series] (accessed March 23, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; There have been subsequent translations of the miniAtlas into Russia, Japanese and Arabic.

In 2010 the Human Security Report Project launched the Human Security Report 2009/2010 at the United Nations.  Part I of the Report examines &quot;The Causes of Peace&quot; since the end of World War II. Part II examines &quot;The Shrinking Costs of War,&quot; paying particular attention to &quot;indirect deaths&quot; from war-exacerbated disease and malnutrition. Part III reviews recent trends in organized violence around the world.

The hard copy version of the Report will be published by Oxford University Press early in 2011.  The text of the Report is freely available online at www.hsrgroup.org.

In addition to its publications, the Project runs several free e-services available in a number of delivery formats:

*[[Human Security Gateway]].
*[http://www.hsrgroup.org/our-work/e-newsletters/overview.aspx Human Security Research].

== Funding and Collaboration ==
The Project works closely with a number of the world's leading research groups in Peace and Conflict Studies including:&lt;ref&gt;Human Security Report Project: [http://www.hsrgroup.org/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=28&amp;Itemid=56 Partners] (accessed March 23, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[International Peace Research Institute, Oslo]] based in [[Norway]].
*the [[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]] based in [[Sweden]].

It has received funding from a number of governments including:

*[[Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade]].
*[[United Kingdom]]'s [[Department for International Development]].
*[[Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]
*[[Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency]]
*[[Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs]].

The HSRP is a Principal Partner of the [[International Relations and Security Network]].

== Criticism ==

Lack of robust conflict data remains a major problem with all attempts to track conflict numbers and fatality trends. The Uppsala Conflict Data Program's has an acknowledged tendency to under-count fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;Human Security Report 2005: [http://www.humansecurityreport.info/HSR2005_PDF/Part2.pdf Part II- The Human Security Audit] (accessed March 22, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; But the tendency to undercount does not obscure trends and both researchers and policymakers who focus on the causes of war and peace are more concerned with trends??are the number of wars/battle deaths increasing or decreasing???than in absolute numbers. For Truth and Reconciliation Commissions the reverse is true.  There are various methodologies that can be used to estimate war deaths??incident-based reporting like that undertaken by the Uppsala Conflict Data Program, nationwide retrospective mortality surveys like those undertaken in Iraq and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and censuses.  Each has strengths and weaknesses. Uppsala's methodology is, however, the only one that permits timely annual updates for all conflict-affected countries. There are ongoing debates on the validity of data compiling and counting methodology.  Part III of the 2009/2010 Human Security Report contains a discussion of these debates.

<text>
'''War porn''' refers to images and video footage of [[Soldier|military personnel]] and encounters.  The term is used by both a community of fans&lt;ref&gt;Got War Porn?&lt;/ref&gt; and by critical [[media theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Pasquinelli 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The images and video are typically of fatal U.S. engagements with [[Insurgency|insurgent groups]] in the war zones of [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]], though Katrien Jacobs includes the [[Abu Ghraib]] torture photos released by [[Salon.com]] in 2005 in her definition.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs 2009&lt;/ref&gt;The site gotwarporn.com states its purpose as &quot;Countering cyber-[[jihad]] one video at a time.&quot; Users can select videos from categories based on the type of weapons technology involved, for instance &quot;30MM Bushmaster&quot; or &quot;M1A1/M1A2,&quot; as general categories such as &quot;Historical&quot; and &quot;Compilations.&quot; A special category, &quot;Bodies,&quot; contains compilation clips set to [[Drowning Pool]]'s &quot;[[Bodies (Drowning Pool song)|Bodies]].&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Got War Porn?&lt;/ref&gt;

An early example of war porn on the internet was nowthatsfuckedup.com. Jacobs examines the rise and fall of nowthatsfuckedup.com from an amateur [[Internet pornography|porn site]] to a forum where [[Military of the United States|U.S. soldiers]] posted pictures of dead insurgents killed in combat operations. nowthatsfuckedup.com was forced to close when an obscenity suit was filed against the site's owner, Chris Wilson, by the 10th [[Legal district|Judicial District]] of Florida. An article in [[The Nation|the Nation magazine]] from 2005 also notes that some of the pictures posted to nowthatsfuckedup.com seemed to be of Iraqi [[civilian]]s, rather than insurgents.&lt;ref&gt;Zornick 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people have engaged in '''[[cross-dressing]] during wartime''' under various circumstances and for various motives. This has been especially true of women, whether while serving as a soldier in otherwise all-male armies, while protecting or disguising their identity in dangerous circumstances, or for other purposes. Conversely, men would dress as women to avoid being drafted, the mythological precedent for this being [[Achilles]] hiding at the court of [[Lycomedes]] dressed as a girl to avoid participation in the [[Trojan War]].

== As a major plot device in fiction ==
{{See also|Cross-dressing in film and television}}

* In [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s fantasy novel ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', [[?owyn]], the White Lady of Rohan, pretends to be a man and slips off to combat the forces of Mordor.
* In ''[[All the Queen's Men]]'', a 2001 comedy set during WWII, cross-dressing is a central plot device.
* [[Terry Pratchett]]'s novel ''[[Monstrous Regiment (novel)|Monstrous Regiment]]'' is a satirical look at the phenomenon.
* ''I was a Male War Bride'' is a comedy where the male French officer, played by [[Cary Grant]], must dress like a woman to return as a [[war bride]] of his American military wife.
* One of the running gags of the TV series ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'' is [[Maxwell Klinger|Klinger]]'s attempts to get discharge from military service by crossdressing.
* In the [[Walt Disney Feature Animation|Disney]] film ''[[Mulan]]'', which is based on the story of [[Hua Mulan]], Mulan dresses as a male to save her father from being drafted.
* In [[Tamora Pierce]]'s ''[[The Song of the Lioness]]'' quartet of books, [[Alanna of Trebond]] disguises herself as a boy named Alan and goes to be trained in place of her twin brother to become a royal knight, a position only given to noble-born boys.  Over the course of the four books, and others in the Tortall Universe, Alanna proceeds to fight for the kingdom as an accomplished knight both before and after the discovery of her true gender.
* ''[[Genesis Climber Mospeada]]'' was perhaps the first [[anime]] series to feature a regular crossdresser amongst the main protagonists. Yellow Belmont, a former soldier, crossdressed to avoid anti-soldier reprisals by the [[Imbit]] and others, and eventually became an accomplished pop singer. During the course of the series, Yellow would cross-dress to hold concerts, enabling his soldier comrades to procure much needed supplies for their war against the Imbit. Yellow had many fans of his music; none outside of his circle of friends realized he was a man until he revealed it to the public during the final episode of Mospeada.
* [[H. E. Bates]]'s novel ''The Triple Echo'' is about a World War II army deserter who cross-dresses to avoid arrest. This was made into a [[The Triple Echo|film]] in 1972.
* Mary &quot;Jacky&quot; Faber does this as the titular heroine of the [[Bloody_Jack_(novel)|Bloody Jack]] series of novels, fighting in the Napoleonic Wars.
*[[Leviathan_(Westerfeld_novel)|Leviathan]] by Scott Westerfeld, a steampunk novel in which Deryn &quot;Dylan&quot; Sharp disguises herself so she can join the Royal Air Service.
* In Shakespeare's ''[[As You Like It]]'', the lead character Rosalind during part of the play disguises herself as a man named Ganymede. Since all players in Shakespeare's time were male, this meant that a man played a woman disguised as a man. Though the setting of the play is not military, Ganymede's disguise is warrior-like: &quot;A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh, a boar-spear in my hand; and -- in my heart lie there what hidden woman's fear there will -- we'll have a swashing and a martial outside.&quot;
* In the manga and subsequent television series ''[[The Rose of Versailles]]'', Lady [[Oscar Fran?ois de Jarjayes]] acts as the head of the Versailles royal guards and the personal bodyguard of Princess, later Queen, [[Marie Antoinette]] during the years leading up to the [[French Revolution]].  What is unique about her cross-dressing is that, while Oscar wears men's clothing full time and conducts herself as a man, she is open about being female.

The '''Geneva Declaration on Armed Violence and Development''' highlights the role that states and [[civil society]] must play in preventing and reducing [[violence]] associated with [[war]], [[crime]], and [[social unrest]]. The Declaration was adopted on 7 June 2006 and is now endorsed by over 100 states.The Geneva Declaration commits signatories to:&lt;ref&gt;Geneva Declaration Secretariat. 2008. ''The Global Burden of Armed Violence. Geneva: Geneva Declaration Secretariat&lt;/ref&gt;

* Support initiatives to measure the human, social and economic costs of armed violence;
* Undertake assessments to understand and respond to risks and vulnerabilities;
* Evaluate the effectiveness of armed violence prevention and reduction programs around the world; and
* To disseminate lessons and best practices.

Understanding that the fight against the global scourge of armed violence and the prospects for sustainable development are closely linked, the signatories recognize that armed violence constitutes a major obstacle to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genevadeclaration.org/fileadmin/docs/Geneva-Declaration-Millennium-Development-Goals.pdf Armed Violence Prevention and Reduction: A Challenge for Achieving the Millennium Development Goals]&lt;/ref&gt; They agree to strengthen their efforts to integrate [[armed violence reduction]] and conflict prevention programs into national, regional, and multilateral development frameworks and strategies.

The approach is based on three pillars:

# Advocacy: dissemination and coordination initiatives for implementing the Geneva Declaration
# Measurability: country based armed violence mapping and monitoring to identify entry-points and opportunities for interventions
# Programming: practical programming on armed violence prevention and reduction

{{About|the field of study|television channel of the same name|Military History (TV channel)}}{{War}}
'''Military history''' is a [[humanities]] [[List of academic disciplines|discipline]] within the scope of [[History|general historical]] recording of [[War|armed conflict]] in the [[Human history|history of humanity]], and its impact on the societies, their cultures, economies and changing [[Politics|intra]] and [[international relations]]hips.

Professional historians normally focus on military affairs that had a major impact on the societies involved as well as the aftermath of conflicts, while amateur historians and hobbyists often take a larger interest in the details of battles, equipment and uniforms in use.

The essential subjects of military history study are the causes of war, the social and cultural foundations, [[Doctrine#Military usage|military doctrine on each side]], the logistics, leadership, technology, [[strategy]], and [[military tactics|tactics]] used, and how these changed over time.

As an applied field, military history has been studied at academies and service schools because the [[Command and control (military)|military command]] seeks to not repeat past mistakes, and improve upon its current performance by instilling an ability in commanders to perceive historical parallels during a battle, so as to capitalize on the lessons learned from the past.

The discipline of military history is dynamic, changing with development as much of the subject area as the societies and organisations that make use of it.&lt;ref&gt;Cowley, Parker, p.xiii&lt;/ref&gt; The dynamic nature of the discipline of military history is largely related to the rapidity of change the military forces, and the art and science of managing them, as well as the frenetic pace of [[Technological evolution|technological development]] that had taken place during the period known as the [[Industrial Revolution]], and more recently in the [[Nuclear proliferation|nuclear]] and [[information age]]s.

An important recent concept is the [[Revolution in Military Affairs]] (RMA) which attempts to explain how warfare has been shaped by emerging technologies, such as gunpowder. It highlights the short outbursts of rapid change followed by periods of relative stability.

==Historiography of military history==
[[Historiography]] is the study of the history of history and in this case, of the field of military history, to gain an accurate assessment of conflicts using all available sources.  For this reason military history is periodised, creating overlaying boundaries of study and analysis in which descriptions of battles by leaders may be unreliable due to the inclination to minimize mention of failure and exaggerate successes. Military historians use Historiographical analysis in an effort to allow an unbiased, contemporary view of records.&lt;ref&gt;Morillo, Pevkovic, pp.4-5&lt;/ref&gt;

One military historian, Jeremy Black, in a recent work mentioned some problems 21st century military historians face as an inheritance of their predecessors: Eurocentricity, a technological bias, a focus on leading military powers and dominant military systems, the separation of land from sea and recently air conflicts, the focus on state-to-state conflict, a lack of focus on political &quot;tasking&quot; in how forces are used.&lt;ref name=&quot;p.ix, Black&quot;&gt;Black, p.ix&lt;/ref&gt;

If these challenges were not sufficient for the military historians, the limits of method are complicated by the lack of records, either destroyed or never recorded for its value as a [[military secret]] that may prevent some salient facts from being reported at all; scholars still do not know the exact nature of [[Greek fire]] for instance. Despite these limits, wars are some of the most studied and detailed periods of human history.

Military historians have often [[Comparative history|compared]] organization, tactical and strategic ideas, leadership, and national support of the militaries of different nations.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kennedy, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers: Economic Change and Military Conflict from 1500 to 2000'' (Random House, 1987)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early historians==
The documentation of military history begins with the confrontation between Sumer (current [[Iraq]]) and Elam (current [[Iran]]) c. 2700 BCE near the modern [[Basra]], and includes such enduring records as the [[Hebrew Bible]]. Other prominent records in military history are the ''[[Trojan War]]'' in [[Homer]]'s [[Iliad]] (though its [[historicity of the Iliad|historicity]] has been challenged), ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'' by [[Herodotus]] (484 BC - 425 BC) who is often called the &quot;father of history&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/tasmania/stories/s999564.htm Herodotus: the father of history], Warburton&lt;/ref&gt; Next was [[Thucydides]] whose impartiality, despite being an [[Athens|Athenian]], allowed him to take advantage of his exile to research the war from different perspectives by carefully examining documents and interviewing eyewitnesses.&lt;ref&gt;Farah, Karls, pp. 137-138&lt;/ref&gt; An approach centered around the analysis of a leader was taken by [[Xenophon]] (430 BC - 355 BC) in ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'', recording the expedition of [[Cyrus the Younger]] into [[Anatolia]].

The records of the Roman [[Julius Caesar]] (100 BC - 44 BC) enable a comparative approach for [[Military campaign|campaign]]s such as ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'' and ''[[Commentarii de Bello Civili]]''.

==Technological evolution==
{{rquote|right|The nature of warfare ''never'' changes, only its superficial manifestations. [[Joshua]] and [[David]], [[Hector]] and [[Achilles]] would recognize the combat that our soldiers and Marines have waged in the alleys of Somalia and Iraq. The uniforms evolve, bronze gives way to titanium, arrows may be replaced by laser-guided bombs, but the heart of the matter is still killing your enemies until any survivors surrender and do your will.|[[Ralph Peters]]&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Ralph. &quot;New Glory: Expanding America's Supremacy&quot;, 2005. p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[Image:Ramses II at Kadesh.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Relief of [[Ramses II]] located in [[Abu Simbel]] fighting at the [[Battle of Kadesh]] on a [[chariot]].]]

New weapons development can dramatically alter the face of war.

[[Chariot]]s, pulled by animals like the [[onager]], [[ox]], [[donkey]], and later the [[horse]], originated around 2000 BC. The chariot was an effective, fast weapon; while one man controlled the maneuvering of the chariot, a second bowman could shoot arrows at enemy soldiers. These became crucial to the maintenance of several governments, including the [[New Egyptian Kingdom]] and the [[Shang Dynasty]] and the nation states of early to mid [[Zhou dynasty]].

Some of the military unit types and technologies which were developed in the ancient world are:

*[[Sling (weapon)|Slinger]]
*[[Hoplite]]
*[[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|Auxiliaries]]
*[[Infantry]]
*[[Crossbowmen]]
*[[Chariots]]
*[[Cavalry]]

For settled agrarian civilizations, the [[infantry]] would become the core of military action. The infantry started as opposing armed groups of soldiers underneath commanders. The [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and early Romans used rigid, heavily armed [[phalanx formation|phalanxes]]. The Macedonians and Hellenistic states would adopt phalanx formations with [[sarissa]] pikemen. The [[Roman Army|Romans]] would later adopt more flexible maniples from their neighbors which made them extremely successful in the field of battle. The kingdoms of the [[Warring States]] in East Asia also adopted infantry combat, a transition from chariot warfare from centuries earlier.

[[Cavalry]] would become an important tool. In the [[Sicilian Expedition]], led by [[Athens]] in an attempt to subdue [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], the well-trained Syracusan cavalry became crucial to the success of the Syracusans. [[Macedon]]ian [[Alexander the Great]] effectively deployed his cavalry forces to secure victories. In battles such as the [[Battle of Cannae]] of the [[Second Punic War]], and the [[Battle of Carrhae]] of the [[Roman-Persian Wars]], the importance of the cavalry would be repeated.

There were also [[horse archer]]s, who had the ability to shoot on horseback&amp;nbsp;? the [[Parthians]], [[Scythians]], [[Mongols]], and other various steppe people were especially fearsome with this tactic. By the 3rd-4th century CE, heavily armored cavalry became widely adopted by the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], [[Sassanids]], [[Eastern Han Dynasty]] and [[Three Kingdoms]], etc.

Even in the [[World War I|First World War]], cavalry was still considered important; the British mobilized 165,000 horses, the Austrians 600,000, the Germans 715,000, and the Russians more than a million.&lt;ref name=Keegan&gt;Keegan, p.73&lt;/ref&gt;

The early [[Indo-Iranians]] developed the use of [[chariot]]s in warfare. The [[scythed chariot]] was later invented in India and soon adopted by the Persian Empire.

[[War elephant]]s were often deployed for fighting in ancient warfare. They were first used in India and later adopted by both the [[Persia]]ns and [[Alexander the Great]] against one another. War elephants were also used in the [[Battle of the Hydaspes River]], and by [[Hannibal Barca|Hannibal]] in the [[Second Punic War]] against the Romans.(The effectiveness of war elephants in a battle is a matter of debate)

There were also organizational changes, made possible by better training and intercommunication. [[Combined arms]] was the concept of using [[infantry]], [[cavalry]], and [[artillery]] in a coordinated way.

[[Image:Trireme.jpg|250px|right|thumb|A [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[trireme]]]]
[[Naval warfare]] was often crucial to military success. Early navies used sailing ships without cannons; often the goal was to ram the enemy ships and cause them to sink.

There was human oar power, often using [[Slavery|slaves]], built up to ramming speed. [[Galley]]s were used in the [[3000 BC|3rd millennium BC]] by the [[Crete|Cretan]]s. The [[Ancient Greece|Greek]]s later advanced these ships.

In 1210 BC, the first recorded naval battle was fought between [[Suppiluliuma II]], king of the [[Hittites]], and [[Cyprus]], which was defeated. In the [[Persian Wars]], the navy became of increasing importance.

[[Trireme]]s were involved in more complicated sea-land operations. [[Themistocles]] helped to build up a stronger Greek navy, composed of 310 ships, and defeated the Persians at the [[Battle of Salamis]], ending the Persian invasion of Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Moerbeek, Martijn (January 21, 1998). [http://monolith.dnsalias.org/~marsares/warfare/battle/salamis.html The battle of Salamis, 480 BC.] Accessed May 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[First Punic War]], the war between [[Carthage]] and [[Rome]] started with an advantage to Carthage because of their naval experience. A Roman fleet was built in 261 BC, with the addition of the [[Corvus (weapon)|corvus]] that allowed Roman soldiers onboard the ships to board the enemy ships. The bridge would prove effective at the [[Battle of Mylae]], resulting in a Roman victory.

The [[Vikings]], in the 8th century [[Anno Domini|AD]], invented a ship propelled by oars with a dragon decorating the prow, hence called the [[Drekar|Drakkar]]. The 12th century CE [[Song Dynasty]] invented ships with watertight bulk head compartments while the 2nd century BCE [[Han Dynasty]] invented rudders and sculled oars for their warships.

[[Fortification]]s are important in warfare. Early [[hill-fort]]s were used to protect inhabitants in the [[Iron Age]]. They were primitive forts surrounded by ditches filled with water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeref.com/casterly.htm The Medieval Castle]. Accessed May 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Forts were then built out of mud bricks, stones, wood, and other available materials. Romans used rectangular fortresses built out of wood and stone. As long as there have been fortifications, there have been contraptions to break in, dating back to the times of [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] and earlier. [[Siege]] warfare is often necessary to capture forts.

Some of the military unit types and technologies which were used in the medieval period are:
*[[Artillery]]
*[[Cataphract]]
*[[Condottieri]]
*[[Fyrd]]
*[[Rashidun army|Rashidun]]
*[[Mobile guard]]
*[[Mamluk]]
*[[Janissary]]
*[[Knight]] (see also: [[Chivalry]])
*[[Crossbow]]
*[[Pikeman]]
*[[Samurai]]
*[[Sipahi]]

[[Bow (weapon)|Bows]] and [[Arrow (weapon)|arrows]] were often used by combatants. Egyptians shot arrows from chariots effectively. The [[crossbow]] was developed around 500 BC in [[China]], and was used a lot in the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;Selby, Stephen (2001). [http://www.atarn.org/chinese/bjng_xbow/bjng_xbow.htm A Crossbow Mechanism with Some Unique Features from Shandong, China]. Accessed on May 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[England|English]]/[[Wales|Welsh]] [[longbow]] from the 12th century also became important in the [[Middle Ages]]. It helped to give the English a large early advantage in the [[Hundred Years' War]], even though the English were eventually defeated. The [[Battle of Cr?cy]] and the [[Battle of Agincourt]] are excellent examples of how to destroy an enemy using a [[longbow]]. It dominated battlefields for over a century.

[[Image:Cannon pic.jpg|250px|right|thumb|A small [[English Civil War]]-era cannon]]
In the 10th century, the invention of gunpowder led to many new weapons that were improved over time. [[Blackpowder]] was used in [[China]] since the 4th century, but it was not used as a weapon until the 11th century.

Until the mid-15th century, guns were held in one hand, while the [[explosive charge]] was ignited by the other hand. Then came the [[matchlock]], which was used widely until around the 1720s. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] made drawings of the [[wheel lock]] which made its own sparks. Eventually, the matchlock was replaced by the [[flintlock]].

[[Cannon]]s were first used in Europe in the early 14th century, and played a vital role in the [[Hundred Years' War]]. The first cannons were simply welded metal bars in the form of a cylinder, and the first cannonballs were made of stone. By 1346, at the [[Battle of Cr?cy]], the cannon had been used; at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] they would be used again.&lt;ref&gt;Calvert, J.B. (February 19, 2006) [http://www.du.edu/~jcalvert/tech/cannon.htm Cannons and Gunpowder]. Accessed on May 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 16th century, the first European [[fire ships]] were used. Ships were filled with [[flammable]] materials, set on fire, and sent to enemy lines. This tactic was successfully used by [[Francis Drake]] to scatter the [[Spanish Armada]] at the Battle of [[Gravelines]],&lt;ref&gt;Jorge. [http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Documents/defeat_of_the_armada.htm The &quot;Invincible&quot; Armada]. Accessed on May 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and would later be used by the Chinese, Russians, Greeks, and several other countries in naval battles.

[[Naval mines]] were invented in the 17th century, though they were not used in great numbers until the [[American Civil War]]. They were used heavily in the [[First World War| First]] and [[Second World War]]s.

The first navigable [[submarine]] was built in 1624 by [[Cornelius Drebbel]], it could cruise at a depth of 15 feet (5&amp;nbsp;m). However, the first military submarine was constructed in 1885 by [[Isaac Peral]].

The [[Turtle (submarine)|''Turtle'']] was developed by [[David Bushnell]] during the [[American Revolution]]. [[Robert Fulton]] then improved the submarine design by creating the [[Nautilus (submarine)|''Nautilus'']].&lt;ref&gt;[http://submarinehistory.homestead.com/EarlyUnderwaterwarfare.html Early Underwater Warfare]. California Center for Military History. Accessed on May 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:155fire.jpg|200px|right|thumb|A 155&amp;nbsp;mm [[M198 howitzer]] firing a shell.]]
The [[Howitzer]], a type of [[field artillery]], was developed in 17th century to fire high [[trajectory]] explosive shells at targets that could not be reached by flat trajectory projectiles.

Bayonets also became of wide usage to infantry soldiers. [[Bayonet]] is named after [[Bayonne]], [[France]] where it was first manufactured in the 16th century. It is used often in infantry charges to fight in hand-to-hand combat. General [[Jean Martinet]] introduced the bayonet to the French army. They were used a lot in the [[American Civil War]], and continued to be used in modern wars like the [[Invasion of Iraq]].

[[Balloon (aircraft)|Balloon]]s were first used in warfare at the end of the 18th century. It was first introduced in Paris of 1783; the first balloon traveled over 5&amp;nbsp;miles (8&amp;nbsp;km). Previously military [[Reconnaissance|scouts]] could only see from high points on the ground, or from the mast of a ship. Now they could be high in the sky, signalling to troops on the ground. This made it much more difficult for troop movements to go unobserved.

At the end of the 18th century, iron-cased [[artillery rocket]]s were successfully used militarily in India against the British by [[Tipu Sultan]] of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] during the [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]]. Rockets were generally inaccurate at that time, though [[William Hale (British inventor)|William Hale]], in 1844, was able to develop a better rocket. The new rocket no longer needed the [[rocket stick]], and had a higher accuracy.

In the 1860s there were a series of advancements in [[rifle]]s. The first [[repeating rifle]] was designed in 1860 by a company bought out by [[Winchester Repeating Arms Company|Winchester]], which made new and improved versions. [[Springfield rifle]]s arrived in the mid-19th century also. [[Machine gun]]s arrived in the middle of the 19th century. [[Automatic rifle]]s and [[light machine gun]]s first arrived at the beginning of the 20th century.

Also in the 1860s came the first boats that would later be known as [[torpedo boat]]s. These were first used in the [[American Civil War]], but generally were not successful. Several [[Confederate States of America|Confederates]] used [[spar torpedo]]es, which were bombs on long poles designed to attach to boats. In the later part of the 19th century, the self-propelled [[torpedo]] was developed. The [[HNoMS Rap (1873)HNoMS ''Rap'']]

At the start of the World Wars, various nations had developed weapons that were a surprise to their adversaries, leading to a need to learn from this, and alter how to combat them. [[Flame thrower]]s were first used in the First World War. The French were the first to introduce the [[Armored car (military)|armored car]] in 1902. Then in 1918, the British produced the first [[Armoured personnel carrier|armored troop carrier]]. Many early [[tank]]s were proof of concept but impractical until further development. In [[World War I]], the British and French held a crucial advantage due to their superiority in tanks; the Germans had only a few dozen A&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;V tanks, as well as 170 captured tanks. The British and French both had several hundred each. The French tanks included the 13 ton [[Schneider-Creusot]], with a 75&amp;nbsp;mm gun, and the British had the [[Mark I tank#Mark IV|Mark IV]] and [[Mark I tank#Mark V series|Mark V]] tanks.&lt;ref&gt;Keegan, p.410&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 17, 1903, the [[Wright Brothers]] performed the first controlled, powered, heavier-than-air flight; it went 39 meters (120&amp;nbsp;ft). In 1907, the first [[helicopter]] flew, but it wasn't practical for usage. [[World War I Aviation|Aviation]] became important in [[World War I]], in which several [[Flying ace|aces]] gained fame. In 1911 an [[aircraft]] took off from a [[warship]] for the first time. It was a [[Cruiser (warship)|cruiser]]. [[Takeoff]]s were soon perfected, but deck landings on a cruiser were another matter.  This led to the development of an [[aircraft carrier]] with a decent unobstructed flight deck.

[[Chemical warfare]] exploded into the public consciousness in [[World War I]] but may have been used in earlier wars without as much human attention. The Germans used gas-filled shells at the [[Battle of Bolimov]] on January 3, 1915. These were not lethal, however. In April 1915, the Germans developed a chlorine gas that was highly lethal, and used it to great effect at the [[Second Battle of Ypres]].&lt;ref&gt;Keegan, pp.197-199&lt;/ref&gt;

[[World War II]] gave rise to even more technology. The worth of the [[aircraft carrier]] was proved in the battles between the [[United States]] and [[Japan]] like the [[Battle of Midway]]. [[Radar]] was independently invented by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and [[Axis Powers|Axis powers]]. It used [[radio wave]]s to detect objects. [[Molotov cocktail]]s were invented by General Franco in the Spanish Civil War, directing the Nationalists to use them against Soviet tanks in the assault on Toledo. The [[atomic bomb]] was developed by the [[Manhattan Project]] and [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] in 1945, ultimately ending World War II.

During the [[Cold War]], even though fighting did not actually occur, the superpowers&amp;nbsp;? the [[United States]] and the [[USSR]]&amp;nbsp;? engaged in a [[Nuclear arms race|race]] to develop and increase the level of technology available for military purposes. In the [[space race]], both nations attempted to launch human beings into space to the moon. Other technological advances centered around intelligence (like the [[spy satellite]]) and missiles ([[ballistic missile]]s, [[cruise missile]]s). [[Nuclear submarine]], invented in 1955. This meant submarines no longer had to surface as often, and could run more quietly. They evolved into becoming underwater missile platforms. [[Cruise missile]]s were invented in Nazi Germany during World War II in the form of the V-1.

==Periods of military history==
The influence of technology on military history, and evident Eurocentrism are nowhere more pronounced than in the attempt by the military historians to divide their subject area into more manageable [[Periodization|periods]] of analysis. While general discipline of history subdivides history into Ancient history (Classical antiquity), Middle Ages (Europe, 4th century - 15th century), Early modern period (Europe, 14th century - 18th century), Modern era (Europe, 18th century - 20th century), and the Post-Modern (USA, 1949?present), the periodisation below stresses technological change in its emphasis, particularly the crucial dramatic change during the Gunpowder warfare period.

Periodisation is not uniformly applied through time and space, affirming the claims of Eurocentrism from regional historians. For example what might be described as [[ancient warfare]] is still practised in a number of parts of the world. Other eras that are distinct in [[Europe]]an history, such as the era of [[Medieval warfare]], may have little relevance in [[East Asia]].

===Ancient warfare===
{{details|Ancient warfare}}

Much of what we know of [[ancient history]] is the history of militaries: their conquests, their movements, and their technological [[innovation]]s. There are many reasons for this. [[monarchy|Kingdom]]s and [[empire]]s, the central units of control in the ancient world, could only be maintained through military force. Due to limited agricultural ability, there were relatively few areas that could support large communities, so fighting was common.

[[Weapon]]s and [[armor]], designed to be sturdy, tended to last longer than other artifacts, and thus a great deal of surviving artifacts recovered tend to fall in this category as they are more likely to survive. Weapons and armor were also mass-produced to a scale that makes them quite plentiful throughout history, and thus more likely to be found in archaeological digs.

Such items were also considered signs of prosperity or virtue, and thus were likely to placed in tombs and monuments to prominent warriors. And [[writing]], when it existed, was often used for kings to boast of military conquests or victories.

Writing, when used by the common man, also tended to record such events, as major battles and conquests constituted major events that many would have considered worthy of recording either in an epic such as the [[Homeric]] writings pertaining to the Trojan War, or even personal writings. Indeed the earliest stories center around warfare, as war was both a common and dramatic aspect of life; the witnessing of a major battle involving many thousands of soldiers would be quite a spectacle, even today, and thus considered worthy both of being recorded in song and art, but also in realistic histories, as well as being a central element in a fictional work.

Lastly, as [[nation states]] evolved and empires grew, the increased need for order and efficiency lead to an increase in the number of records and writings. Officials and armies would have good reason for keeping detailed records and accounts involving any and all things concerning a matter such as warfare that in the words of [[Sun Tzu]] was &quot;a matter of vital importance to the state&quot;. For all these reasons, military history comprises a large part of ancient history.

Notable militaries in the ancient world included the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]]s, [[Babylon]]ians, [[Persian Empire|Persians]], Ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] (notably the [[Sparta]]ns and [[Macedon]]ians), [[Military history of India|Indians]] (notably the [[Magadha]]s, [[Gangaridai]]s, [[Gandhara]]s and [[Cholas]]),  Early Imperial [[History of China|Chinese]] (notably the [[Qin (state)|Qin]] and [[Han (state)|Han]] Dynasties), [[Xiongnu]] Confederation, Ancient [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], and [[Carthage|Carthaginians]].

The [[fertile crescent]] of [[Mesopotamia]] was the center of several prehistoric conquests. Mesopotamia was conquered by the [[Sumer]]ians, [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadians]], [[Babylonia]]ns, [[Assyria]]ns and [[Persia]]ns. [[Iran]]ians were the first nation to introduce [[cavalry]] into their army.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suren-Pahlav&quot;&gt;Suren-Pahlav S., ''General Surena; The Hero of Carrhae''&lt;!-- link blocked by spam filter: http://www.cais-soas.com/CAIS/History/ashkanian/surena.htm ; accessed Jan 16, 2007 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Egypt]] began growing as an ancient power, but eventually fell to the [[Persian Empire|Persian]]s, [[Ancient Greece|Greek]]s, [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] and [[Arab]]s.

The earliest recorded battle in [[History of India|India]] was the [[Battle of the Ten Kings]]. The [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epics]] ''[[Mahabharata]]'' and ''[[Ramayana]]'' are centered around conflicts and refer to military formations, theories of warfare and esoteric weaponry. [[Chanakya]]'s ''[[Arthashastra]]'' contains a detailed study on ancient warfare, including topics on [[espionage]] and [[war elephant]]s.

[[Alexander the Great]] invaded Northwestern India and defeated [[King Porus]] in the [[Battle of the Hydaspes River]]. The same region was soon re conquered by [[Chandragupta Maurya]] after defeating the Macedonians and [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]]. He also went on to conquer the [[Nanda Dynasty|Nanda Empire]] and unify Northern India. Most of [[South Asia|Southern Asia]] was unified under his grandson [[Ashoka|Ashoka the Great]] after the [[Kalinga War]], though the empire collapsed not long after his reign.

In [[China]], the [[Shang Dynasty]] and [[Zhou Dynasty]] had risen and collapsed. This led to a [[Warring States Period]], in which several states continued to fight with each other over territory. Philosopher-strategists such as [[Confucius]] and [[Sun Tzu]] wrote various manuscripts on ancient warfare (as well as international diplomacy).

The Warring States era philosopher [[Mozi]] ([[Micius]]) and his [[Mohist]] followers invented various siege weapons and siegecraft, including the Cloud Ladder (a four-wheeled, extendable ramp) to scale fortified walls during a siege of an enemy city. The warring states were first unified by [[Qin Shi Huang]] after a series of military conquests, creating the first empire in China.

His [[Qin Dynasty|empire]] was succeeded by the [[Han Dynasty]], which expanded into Central Asia, Northern China/Manchuria, Southern China, and present day Korea and Vietnam. The Han came into conflict with settled people such as the proto-Korean Gojoseons, and proto-Vietnamese Nanyue. They also came into conflict with the [[Xiongnu]] ([[Huns]]), [[Yuezhi]], and other steppe civilizations.

The Han defeated and drove the [[Xiongnu]]s west, securing the city-states along the silk route that continued into the [[Parthia]]n Empire. After the decline of central imperial authority, the [[Han Dynasty]] collapsed into an era of civil war and continuous warfare during the [[Three Kingdoms]] period in the 3rd century CE.

The [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] [[Persian Empire]] was founded by [[Cyrus the Great]] after conquering the [[Medes|Median Empire]], [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]], [[Lydia]] and [[Asia Minor]]. His successor [[Cambyses II of Persia|Cambyses]] went onto conquer the [[Egyptian Empire]], much of [[Central Asia]], and parts of Greece, India and [[Libya]]. The empire later fell to [[Alexander the Great]] after defeating [[Darius III of Persia|Darius III]]. After being ruled by the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid dynasty]], the Persian Empire was subsequently ruled by the [[Parthia]]n and [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] dynasties, which were the [[Roman Empire]]'s greatest rivals during the [[Roman-Persian Wars]].

In [[Greece]], several [[city-state]]s rose to power, including [[Athens]] and [[Sparta]]. The Greeks successfully stopped two [[Persia]]n invasions, the first at the [[Battle of Marathon]], where the Persians were led by [[Darius I of Persia|Darius the Great]], and the second at  the [[Battle of Salamis]], a naval battle where the Greek ships were deployed by orders of [[Themistocles]] and the Persians were under [[Xerxes I]], and the land engagement of the [[Battle of Plataea]].

The [[Peloponnesian War]] then erupted between the two Greek powers [[Athens]] and [[Sparta]]. Athens built a long wall to protect its inhabitants, but the wall helped to facilitate the spread of a plague that killed about 30,000 Athenians, including [[Pericles]]. After a disastrous campaign against [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], the Athenian navy was decisively defeated by [[Lysander]] at the [[Battle of Aegospotami]].

The [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]], underneath [[Philip II of Macedon]] and [[Alexander the Great]], invaded [[Persia]] and won several major victories, establishing Macedonia as a major power. However, following Alexander's death at an early age, the empire quickly fell apart.

Meanwhile, [[Rome]] was gaining power, following a rebellion against the [[Etruscans]]. During the three [[Punic Wars]], the Romans defeated the neighboring power of Carthage. The [[First Punic War]] centered around [[naval warfare]]. The [[Second Punic War]] started with [[Hannibal Barca|Hannibal]]?s invasion of [[Italy]] by crossing the [[Alps]]. He famously won the encirclement at the [[Battle of Cannae]]. However, after [[Scipio Africanus|Scipio]] invaded Carthage, Hannibal was forced to follow and was defeated at the [[Battle of Zama]], ending the role of Carthage as a power.

After defeating Carthage the Romans went on to become the Mediterranean's dominant power, successfully campaigning in Greece, ([[Aemilius Paulus]] decisive victory over Macedonia at the [[Battle of Pydna]]), in the Middle East ([[Lucius Licinius Lucullus]], [[Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus]]), in [[Gaul]] ([[Julius Caesar|Gaius Julius Caesar]]) and defeating several [[Germanic tribe]]s ([[Gaius Marius]], [[Germanicus]]). While Roman armies suffered several major losses, their large population and ability (and will) to replace battlefield casualties, their training, organization, tactical and technical superiority  enabled Rome to stay a predominant military force for several centuries, utilizing well trained and maneuverable armies to routinely overcome the much larger &quot;tribal&quot; armies of their foes (see Battles of [[Battle of Aquae Sextiae|Aquae Sextiae]], [[Battle of Vercellae|Vercellae]], [[Battle of Tigranocerta|Tigranocerta]], [[Battle of Alesia|Alesia]]).

In 54 BCE the Roman triumvir [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]] took the offensive against the [[Parthian Empire]] in the east. In a decisive battle at [[Battle of Carrhae|Carrhae]] Romans were defeated and the golden [[Aquila (Roman)|Aquilae]] (legionary battle standards) were taken as trophies to [[Ctesiphon]]. The battle was one of the worst defeats suffered by the Roman Republic in its entire history.

While successfully dealing with foreign opponents, Rome experienced numerous civil wars, notably the power struggles of Roman generals such as Marius and [[Sulla]] during the end of the Republic. Caesar was also notable for his role in the civil war against the other member of the Triumvirate (Pompey) and against the Roman Senate.

The successors of Caesar&amp;nbsp;? Octavian and Mark Anthony, also fought a civil war with Caesar's assassins (Senators Brutus, Cassius, etc.). Octavian and Mark Anthony eventually fought another civil war between themselves to determine the sole ruler of Rome. Octavian emerged victorious and Rome was turned into an empire with a huge standing army of professional soldiers.

By the time of [[Marcus Aurelius]], the Romans had expanded to the Atlantic Ocean in the west and to [[Mesopotamia]] in the east and controlled Northern Africa and Central Europe up to the [[Black Sea]]. However, Aurelius marked the end of the [[Five Good Emperors]], and Rome quickly fell into decline.

The [[Hun]]s, [[Goths]], and other barbaric groups invaded Rome, which continued to suffer from [[inflation]] and other internal strifes. Despite the attempts of [[Diocletian]], [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]], and [[Theodosius I]], western Rome collapsed and was eventually conquered in 476. The [[Byzantium|Byzantine empire]] continued to prosper, however.

===Medieval warfare===
{{details|Medieval warfare}}

When [[stirrups]] came into use some time during the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] militaries were forever changed. This invention coupled with technological, cultural, and social developments had forced a dramatic transformation in the character of warfare from [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]], changing [[military]] [[military tactics|tactics]] and the role of [[cavalry]] and [[artillery]].

Similar patterns of warfare existed in other parts of the world. In China around the 5th century armies moved from massed infantry to cavalry based forces, copying the [[steppe]] [[nomad]]s. The [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]] used similar, if often more advanced, technologies than Europe.

In [[Japan]] the Medieval warfare period is considered by many to have stretched into the 19th century. In Africa along the [[Sahel]] and [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]] states like the [[Kingdom of Sennar]] and [[Fulani Empire]] employed Medieval tactics and weapons well after they had been supplanted in Europe.

In the [[Medieval]] period, [[feudalism]] was firmly implanted, and there existed many [[landlord]]s in Europe. Landlords often owned [[castle]]s to protect their territory.

The [[Islam]]ic [[Caliphate|Arab Empire]] began rapidly expanding throughout the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]], and [[Central Asia]], initially led by [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]], and later under the [[Umayyads]].  While their attempts to invade Europe by way of the Balkans were [[Siege of Constantinople (717?718)|defeated]] by [[Byzantium]] and [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Great Battles of Bulgaria]]&lt;/ref&gt; the Arabs expanded to the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in the west and the [[Indus River|Indus Valley]] in the east. The [[Abassid]]s then took over the Arab Empire, though the Umayyads remained in control of [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]].

At the [[Battle of Tours]], the [[Franks]] under [[Charles Martel]] stopped short a Muslim invasion. The Abassids defeated the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] Chinese army at the [[Battle of Talas]], but were later defeated by the [[Seljuk Turk]]s and the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] centuries later, until the Arab Empire eventually came to an end after the [[Battle of Baghdad (1258)|Battle of Baghdad]] in 1258.

In [[China]], the [[Sui Dynasty]] had risen and conquered the Chen Dynasty of the south. They invaded Vietnam (northern Vietnam had been in Chinese control since the Han Dynasty), fighting the troops of [[Champa]], who had cavalry mounted on elephants. After decades of economic turmoil and a failed invasion of Korea, the Sui collapsed and was followed by the [[Tang Dynasty]], who fought with various [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] groups, the [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]] of [[Lhasa]], the [[Tanguts]], the [[Khitans]], and collapsed due to political fragmentation of powerful regional military governors (jiedushi). The innovative [[Song Dynasty]] followed next, inventing new weapons of war that employed the use of [[Greek Fire]] and [[gunpowder]] (see section below) against enemies such as the [[Jurchens]].

The [[Mongol]]s under [[Genghis Khan]], [[Ogedei Khan]], [[Mongke Khan]], and [[Kublai Khan]] conquered most of Eurasia. They took over China, Persia, Turkestan, and Russia. After [[Kublai Khan]] took power and created the [[Yuan Dynasty]], the divisions of the empire ceased to cooperate with each other, and the [[Mongol Empire]] was only nominally united.

In [[New Zealand]], prior to European discovery, oral histories, legends and [[whakapapa]] include many stories of battles and wars. [[M?ori people|M?ori]] warriors were held in high esteem. One group of [[Polynesians]] migrated to the [[Chatham Islands]], where they developed the largely pacifist [[Moriori]] culture. Their pacifism left the Moriori unable to defend themselves when the islands were invaded by mainland M?ori in the 1830s.

They proceeded to [[Wiktionary:massacre|massacre]] the Moriori and [[slavery|enslave]] the survivors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/NewZealanders/MaoriNewZealanders/Moriori/4/en Moriori - The impact of new arrivals - Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newzealandatoz.com/index.php?pageid=607&amp;PHPSESSID=1c2fab7979e45ccc7c3e7336e8636142 New Zealand A to Z | Chatham Islands]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Warrior]] culture also developed in the isolated [[Hawaiian Islands]]. During the 1780s and 1790s the chiefs and alii were constantly fighting for power. After a series of battles the Hawaiian Islands were united for the first time under a single ruler who would become known as [[Kamehameha I]].

===Gunpowder warfare===
{{details|Gunpowder warfare}}

After [[Gunpowder]] weapons were first developed in [[Song Dynasty]] China (see also [[Technology of Song Dynasty]]), the technology later spread west to the [[Ottoman Empire]], from where it spread to the [[Safavid Empire]] of Persia and the [[Mughal Empire]] of India. The [[arquebus]] was later adopted by European armies during the [[Italian Wars]] of the early 16th century.

This all brought an end to the dominance of armored cavalry on the battlefield. The simultaneous decline of the feudal system&amp;nbsp;? and the absorption of the medieval city-states into larger states&amp;nbsp;? allowed the creation of professional standing armies to replace the [[Feudalism|feudal levies]] and mercenaries that had been the standard military component of the Middle Ages.

In [[Africa]], [[Ahmad ibn Ibrihim al-Ghazi]], was the first African commander to use gunpowder on the continent in the [[Ethiopian?Adal War]], that lasted for fourteen years (1529?1543)

The period spanning between the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]] and the 1789 [[French Revolution]] is also known as ''[[Kabinettskriege]]'' (Princes' warfare) as wars were mainly carried out by imperial or monarchics states, decided by cabinets and limited in scope and in their aims. They also involved quickly shifting alliances, and mainly used mercenaries.

Over the course of the 18th-19th centuries all military arms and services underwent significant developments that included a more mobile [[field artillery]], the transition from use of battalion [[infantry drill]] in [[close order formation|close order]] to open order formations and the transfer of emphasis from the use of [[bayonets]] to the rifle that replaced the musket, and virtual replacement of all types of cavalry with the universal [[dragoons]], or [[mounted infantry]].

===Industrial warfare===
{{details|Industrial warfare}}

As weapons?particularly small arms?became easier to use, countries began to abandon a complete reliance on professional soldiers in favor of [[conscription]].  Technological advances became increasingly important; while the armies of the previous period had usually had similar weapons, the industrial age saw encounters such as the [[Battle of Sadowa]], in which possession of a more advanced technology played a decisive role in the outcome.

[[Conscription]] was employed in industrial warfare to increase the number of soldiers that were available for combat. This was used by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] in the [[Napoleonic Wars]].

[[Total war]] was used in industrial warfare, the objective being to prevent the opposing nation to engage in war. [[William Tecumseh Sherman]]'s &quot;March to the Sea&quot; and [[Philip Sheridan]]'s burning of the [[Shenandoah Valley]] are examples of total warfare.

===Modern warfare===
{{details|Modern warfare}}

In modern times, war has evolved from an activity steeped in tradition to a [[scientific enterprise]] where success is valued above methods. The notion of [[total war]] is the extreme of this trend.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Militaries have developed technological advances rivaling the scientific accomplishments of any other field of study.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

However, it should be noted that modern militaries benefit in the development of these technologies under the funding of the [[public]], the leadership of [[Central government|national governments]], and often in cooperation with large [[civilian]] groups, such as the [[General Dynamics]] and [[Lockheed Martin]] corporations, in the [[United States]]. And as for &quot;total war,&quot; it may be argued that it is not an exclusive practice of modern militaries, but in the tradition of [[Ethnic war|genocidal conflict]] that marks even tribal warfare to this day.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

What distinguishes modern military organizations from those previous is not their willingness to prevail in conflict by any method, but rather the technological variety of tools and methods available to modern battlefield commanders, from [[submarine]]s to [[satellite]]s, from [[Knife|knives]] to [[nuclear warheads]].

Some of the military unit types and technologies which were developed in modern times are:

*[[Ammunition]]
*[[Armory (military)|Armory]]
*[[Conscription]]
*[[Grenade Launcher|Grenadier]]
*[[Sapping|Sappers]] and [[Mining (military)|Miners]]
*[[marine (armed services)|Marine]]
*[[Military aviation|Aviation]]
*[[Rifleman]]
*[[Special Forces]]
*[[Naval Combatant]]
*[[Global Information Grid]]
*[[Active Electronically Scanned Array]]
*[[Network-centric warfare]]
*[[Supercomputer]]
*[[Space warfare]]
*[[Cyberwar]]

[[World War I]] was sparked by the assassination of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]], leading to the mobilization of [[Austria]] and [[Serbia]]. The [[Germany|Germans]] joined the Austrians to form the Central powers; the [[France|French]], [[United Kingdom|British]], and [[Russia]]ns formed the Allied powers. Following the [[First Battle of the Marne|Battle of the Marne]] and the outflanking attempt of both nations in the &quot;[[Race to the Sea]]&quot;, [[trench warfare]] ensued, leaving the war in a great deadlock.

Major operations by the Germans at the [[Battle of Verdun]] and by the British and the French at the [[Battle of the Somme]] were carried out, and new technology like tanks and chlorine gas were used. Following the [[United States of America|USA's]] entrance into the war, the Germans and their allies were eventually defeated.

[[World War II]] ensued after [[Germany]]'s invasion of [[Poland]], forcing [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[France]] to declare war. Germany quickly defeated France and Belgium, later aided by Italy. A hasty evacuation occurred at [[Dunkirk]] to save the Allied army from complete destruction. The Germans then attacked [[USSR]] and marched to take over the [[Soviet]] resources, but were thwarted.

Meanwhile, Japan, who had [[Second Sino-Japanese War|already been at war]] with the Chinese since 1937, had launched a surprise attack on [[Pearl Harbor]], leading the [[United States]] to join the Allied powers. In Europe, the Allies opened three fronts: in the west, after securing [[Normandy]]; in the east, aiding the Soviet Union; and in the south, through Italy. Germany eventually surrendered, upon which the Allies turned and focused troops to do [[Leapfrogging (strategy)|island hopping]]. The dropping of the [[atom bomb]]s on [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] led to the surrender of Japan and the end of the Second World War.

Worsening relationships between wartime Allies developed into the [[Cold War]], reaching a climax during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] at the same time as the [[Sino-Indian War]]. Hostilities never actually occurred, though the US-backed UN forces did engage against the [[communist]] states in the [[Korean War]] and the [[Vietnam War]].

==On civilians==
Many wars have been accompanied by significant depopulations. During the [[Thirty Years' War]] in Europe, for example, the population of the [[Holy Roman Empire|German]] states was reduced by about 30%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/warstat0.htm#30YrW The Thirty Years War (1618?48)], Alan McFarlane, The Savage Wars of Peace: England, Japan and the Malthusian Trap (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/195896/history-of-Europe/58335/Demographics#ref=ref310375 History of Europe ? Demographics]. Encyclop?dia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Swedish Empire|Swedish]] armies alone may have destroyed up to 2,000 castles, 18,000 villages and 1,500 towns in Germany, one-third of all German towns.&lt;ref name=&quot;Population-HLS&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Estimates for the total [[World War II casualties|casualties of World War II]] vary, but most suggest that some 60 million people died in the war, including about 20 million soldiers and 40 million civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World War II Fatalities|url=http://www.secondworldwar.co.uk/casualty.html|accessdate=2007-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Soviet Union]] lost around [[World War II casualties of the Soviet Union|27 million people]] during the war, about half of all World War II casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4530565.stm|title=Leaders mourn Soviet wartime dead | date=May 9, 2005 | accessdate=January 6, 2010 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest number of civilian deaths in a single city was 1.2 million citizens dead during the 872-day [[Siege of Leningrad]].

==On the economy==
{{See also|Military keynesianism}}

Once a war has ended, losing nations are sometimes required to pay [[war reparations]] to the victorious nations. In certain cases, land is ceded to the victorious nations. For example, the territory of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] has been traded between France and Germany on three different occasions.

Typically speaking, war becomes very intertwined with the economy and many wars are partially or entirely based on economic reasons such as the [[American Civil War]]. In some cases war has stimulated a country's economy (World War II is often credited with bringing America out of the [[Great Depression]]) but in many cases, such as the wars of Louis XIV, the [[Franco-Prussian War]], and [[World War I]], warfare serves only to damage the economy of the countries involved. For example, Russia's involvement in World War I took such a toll on the Russian economy that it almost collapsed and greatly contributed to the start of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]].

===World War II===
{{See main article|World War II}}
One of the starkest illustrations of the effect of war upon economies is the [[Second World War]]. The [[Great Depression]] of the [[1930s]] ended as nations increased their production of war materials to serve the [[war effort]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/learn/features/timeline/depwwii/depwar.html Great Depression and World War II]. ''The Library of Congress''.&lt;/ref&gt; The financial cost of World War II is estimated at about a $1.944 [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)#1012|trillion]] U.S. dollars worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, E. (2000) [http://emayzine.com/lectures/WWII.html &quot;World War II&quot;] course lecture notes on ''Emayzine.com'' (Victorville, California: Victor Valley College)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, P. (1999) [http://members.aol.com/forcountry/ww2/wc1.htm &quot;Cost of the War,&quot;] ''World War II Resource Guide'' (Gardena, California: The American War Library)&lt;/ref&gt; making it the most costly war in capital as well as lives.

Property damage in the Soviet Union inflicted by the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Axis invasion]] was estimated to a value of 679 billion rubles. The combined damage consisted of complete or partial destruction of 1,710 cities and towns, 70,000 villages/hamlets, 2,508 church buildings, 31,850 industrial establishments, 40,000 miles of railroad, 4100 railroad stations, 40,000 hospitals, 84,000 schools, and 43,000 public libraries.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New York Times]]'', 9 February 1946, Volume 95, Number 32158.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TWCleanup}}{{Orphan|date=January 2009}}{{One source|date=January 2009}}
'''Progressive War'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Caleb Carr|Caleb, Carr]] (2002). ''The Lessons of Terror: A History of Warfare Against Civilians: Why It Has Always Failed and Why It Will Fail Again''. Random House, Inc. ISBN 0-375-50843-0&lt;/ref&gt; is a military term encompassing a military strategy where only enemy combatants are targeted and civilian [[collateral damage]] and casualties are kept to a minimum. The principles for Progressive War were established by Dutch jurist [[Hugo Grotius]] who is consider a founder of international law in his book [[De jure belli ac pacis libri tres]](On the Law of War and Peace: Three books) published in 1625. A successful practitioner of Progressive War was [[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder]] as chief of staff of the [[Prussian Army]] in the nineteenth century.

The obverse to Progressive War is Unlimited War which includes civilian populations as legitimate targets. The aim of Unlimited War is to use military action against civilians in the hope of undermining the populations will to fight, to undermine their support of their leaders and thereby influence the policies of those leaders to continue the conflict. Examples of Unlimited War is evident in the use of [[cluster bomb]]s, the [[bombing of Dresden in World War II]], the German bombing of London among many other examples.

The philosophy of Unlimited War is controversial. Many consider it a form of terrorism, in the sense of deliberately attacking civilians in the hope of changing their mindset. Such ambiguities between Unlimited Warfare and terrorist strategies could be the source of why many terrorist groups consider themselves soldiers, and many label American military forces terrorists.

Guerrilla warfare can be considered Progressive if only enemy combatants are targeted, but becomes terrorism when civilians are targeted.

War loot

{{refimprove|date=December 2010}}{{Mergeto | Looting| discuss=Talk:War_loot#Looting | date=December 2009}}
'''War loot''' refers to goods, valuables and property obtained by force from their lawful owners via [[looting]] during or after warfare. These &quot;spoils of war&quot; differ from [[tribute]]s, [[war reparations]], or other payments extracted after the fact by a victorious nation in that their extraction is largely arbitrary and immediate, being administered by the armed forces themselves rather than by treaty or agreement between the parties involved.

==History, rationale, targets and perpetrators==

Looting by a victorious army during war has been common practice throughout recorded history. For foot soldiers, it was viewed as a way to supplement their often meagre income&lt;ref name=hsc&gt;Hsi-sheng Chi, ''Warlord politics in China, 1916-1928'', Stanford University Press, 1976University , ISBN 0804708940, str. 93&lt;/ref&gt; and was part of the celebration of victory. On higher levels, the proud exhibition of loot was an integral part of the typical [[Roman triumph]] and [[Genghis Khan]] was not unusual in proclaiming that:

{{cquote|The greatest happiness was to vanquish, devastate and rob one's enemies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thinkexist.com/quotation/the-greatest-happiness-is-to-vanquish-your/1393183.html Thinkexist.com], Genghis Khan quotes&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In warfare in ancient times, the spoils of war included the defeated populations, which were often enslaved, and the women and children, who were often absorbed into the victorious country's population.&lt;ref&gt;John K. Thorton, ''African Background in American Colonization'', in ''The Cambridge economic history of the United States'', Stanley L. Engerman, Robert E. Gallman (ed.), Cambridge University Press, 1996, ISBN 0521394422, p.87: ''African states waged war to acquire slaves [...] raids that appear to have been more concerned with obtaining loot (including slaves) than other objectives.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sir John Bagot Glubb, ''The Empire of the Arabs'', Hodder and Stoughton, 1963, p.283: ''thousand Christian captives formed part of the loot and were subsequently sold as slaves in the markets of Syria''&lt;/ref&gt; In other pre-modern societies, objects made of precious metals were the preferred target of war looting, largely because of their easy portability. In many cases looting was an opportunity to obtain treasures that otherwise would not have been obtainable. Since the 18th century, [[looted art|works of art]] have increasingly become a popular target. In the 1930s and even more so during [[World War II]], [[Nazi Germany]] engaged in large scale and organized [[Nazi plunder|looting of art and property]].&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} J. R. Kudelski, ''Tajemnice nazistowskiej grabie?y polskich zbior?w sztuki'', Warszawa 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union also engaged in massive looting at the end of WWII.

Looting, combined with poor [[military discipline]], has occasionally been an army's downfall. In other cases, for example the [[Wahhabi sack of Karbala]], loot has financed further victories.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne H. Bowen, ''The History of Saudi Arabia'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 2008, ISBN 0313340129, [http://books.google.com/books?id=S6J2Q3TlJpMC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=1805+saudi+karbala&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=z7xkfvrX_x&amp;sig=yg1NCeie86areM74Tp0N2ROwUf8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=f4cCTbnlLsL38AaO_dTrAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=1805%20saudi%20karbala&amp;f=false Google Print,p.73]&lt;/ref&gt; Not all looters in wartime are conquerors; the looting of [[Vistula Land]] by its retreating defenders in 1915&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} Andrzej Garlicki, ''Z dziej?w Drugiej Rzeczypospolitej'', Wydawnictwa Szkolne i Pedagogiczne, 1986, ISBN 8302022454, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; was among the factors sapping the loyalty of [[Poland in World War I]]. Local civilians can also take advantage of a breakdown of authority to loot public and private property, such as took place at the [[National Museum of Iraq]] in the course of the [[Iraq War]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;STEVEN LEE MYERS, [http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/24/world/middleeast/24museum.html Iraq Museum Reopens Six Years After Looting], New York Times, February 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Changing attitudes and international regulations==
In modern times attitudes changed and [[laws of war]] gradually came to apply to loot. Economic devastation, including that caused by the [[Thirty Years' War]] encouraged the trend. Official looters accordingly became less boastful of their plunder but rather offered euphemisms and excuses; the [[Siege of Jaffa]] was one of the last prominent occasions of a Western commander brazenly encouraging rape and wanton destruction in a captured city.

'''Conflict resource'''s are [[natural resource]]s extracted in a conflict zone and sold to perpetuate the fighting.&lt;ref&gt;p.8, Conflict and Development: Peacebuilding and Post-conflict Resolution; Sixth Report of Session 2005-06, Great Britain: Parliament: House of Commons: International Development Committee, The Stationery Office, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; There is both anecdotal and statistical evidence that belligerent accessibility to precious commodities can prolong conflicts (a &quot;[[Resource_curse#Conflict|resource curse]]&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Le Billon, &quot;Fuelling War: Natural Resources and Armed Conflicts&quot;, Adelphi Paper 373, IISS &amp; Routledge, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Ross]],&quot;How Do Natural Resources Influence Civil War?

The concept of 'conflict resource', or 'conflict [[commodity]]' emerged in the late 1990s, initially in relation to '[[conflict diamonds]]' financing rebellions in Angola and [[Sierra Leone]]. (The media often called these '[[blood diamonds]]'.)&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Then 'conflict timber' financed hostilities in Cambodia and [[Liberia]].&lt;ref&gt;

The concept was first officially discussed by the UN General Assembly for 'conflict diamonds':.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mmsd1.mms.nrcan.gc.ca/kimberleyprocess/UN_Resolution_e.pdf  UNGA Resolution 55/56 (2001)]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[UN Security Council]] has since referred to conflict resources in several resolutions.

The advocacy group [[Global Witness]] has called for an international definition facilitating a more systematic application of UN resolutions, the prevention of complicity in abuses during hostilities by commercial entities exploiting or trading in conflict resources, and the prosecution of [[war profiteer]]s suspected of supporting or abetting war criminals.[http://www.humansecuritybulletin.info/page434.htm].

&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from [[fossil fuel]]s, metals, diamonds, and timber it tracks the [[governance]] of other [[Raw material|primary goods]] that might fund conflicts, including: [[poppy seed]]s (Afghanistan), [[rubber]] (C?te d'Ivoire), [[cotton]] (Zambia), and [[cocoa bean|cocoa]] (Indonesia).

{{Multiple issues|notability =April 2009|primarysources =April 2009|synthesis =April 2009|orphan =March 2009}}Armed conflicts ? including cross-border and civil wars ? destroy lives and livelihoods. Both combatants and civilians are killed as a result of armed conflict. But establishing a firm estimate of the numbers of '''people directly killed as a result of war''' is challenging owing to limited reporting and surveillance in affected areas. Moreover, data is often manipulated for political motives.

The [http://www.genevadeclaration.org/resources-armed-violence-report.html Global Burden of Armed Violence (GBAV)] report seeks to establish a global estimate of direct conflict deaths between 2004 and 2007. The estimate draws from a wide combination of conflict databases, national datasets, and studies that draw primarily on incident-reporting methods. While survey-based assessments of those dying directly and from secondary causes are increasing in number, there are currently insufficient to generate a meaningful global profile of those killed during war.

The study finds that approximately 52,000 direct conflict deaths occurred each year between 2004 and 2007. Altogether at least 208,300 people died directly as a result of armed conflict. Between 2005 and 2007 the total number of direct conflict deaths increased to an estimated 63,900 per annum as compared to lower annual tolls in 2004 and 2005. This increase is due primarily to armed violence in Iraq, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, and Somalia&lt;ref&gt;Geneva Declaration Secretariat. 2008. The Global Burden of Armed Violence. Geneva: Geneva Declaration Secretariat&lt;/ref&gt;.

The GBAV finds that the distribution of direct conflict deaths is not uniform. Direct conflict deaths tend to be highly concentrated in a limited number of countries. Approximately two thirds (66 per cent) of all direct conflict deaths between 2004 and 2007 occurred in Asia, almost one-quarter (24 per cent) in Africa, 6 per cent in the Americas and 2 per cent in Europe&lt;ref&gt;Geneva Declaration Secretariat. 2008. The Global Burden of Armed Violence. Geneva: Geneva Declaration Secretariat, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;.

A review of direct conflict deaths provides a partial picture of the burden of armed violence. The total number of people dying violently during conflict (52,000) is relatively low in comparison to those dying indirectly from armed conflict (200,000) and those experiencing violent deaths in areas that are not affected by armed conflict (540,000) [[List of countries by intentional homicide rate]] each year.

It is important to stress that a global estimate of direct conflict deaths provides only a partial understanding of the overall burden of war, much less armed violence. For example, the total number of people dying violently during conflict (52,000) is relatively low in comparison to those dying indirectly from armed conflict (200,000). While still extremely high, it is also comparatively modest when compared to the number of people killed in countries ostensibly unaffected by armed conflict (540,000) [[List of countries by intentional homicide rate]] each year.

{{Orphan|date=February 2009}}A '''War referendum''' is a type of [[referendum]] in which citizens decide whether a nation should go to war.

The earliest idea of a war referendum came from [[Marquis de Condorcet]] in 1793 and [[Immanuel Kant]] in 1795.&lt;ref name=&quot;ballot&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

Civilian casualty ratio
</title>
<id>
100
</id>
<text>
{{Disputed|date=July 2011}}In [[armed conflict]]s, the '''civilian casualty ratio''' (also '''civilian death ratio''', '''civilian-combatant ratio''', etc.) is the [[ratio]] of [[civilian casualties]] to [[combatant]] casualties, or total casualties. The measurement can apply either to casualties inflicted by a particular [[belligerent]], or to casualties in the conflict as a whole.
According to a 2001 study by the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]], the civilian-to-soldier death ratio in wars fought since the mid-20th century has been 10:1, meaning ten civilian deaths for every soldier death.&lt;ref&gt;Sabrina Tavernise and Andrew W. Lehren,
[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/23/world/middleeast/23casualties.html?_r=2 A Grim Portrait of Civilian Deaths in Iraq], New York Times 22-10-2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mexican Revolution (1910?20)==
Although it's estimated at least 1 million people died in the [[Mexican Revolution]], most died from disease and hunger as an indirect result of the war. Combat deaths are generally agreed to have totaled about 250,000. According to Eckhardt, these included 125,000 civilian deaths and 125,000 military deaths, creating a civilian-combatant death ratio of 1:1 among combat deaths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/warstat2.htm Twentieth Century Atlas&amp;nbsp;?

Retrieved on 2010-11-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War I==
{{see also|World War I casualties}}
Some 9 to 10 million combatants on both sides are estimated to have died during [[World War I]], along with an estimated 6.6 million civilians. The civilian casualty rate in [[World War I]] is therefore approximately 2:3 or 40%. Most of the civilian fatalities were due to famine or [[Spanish flu]] rather than military action. The relatively low rate of civilian casualties in this war is due to the fact that the front lines on the main battlefront, the [[Western Front (WWI)|Western Front]], were static for most of the war, so that civilians were able to avoid the combat zones. Casualties for the Western allies, consequently, were relatively slight. Germany, on the other hand, suffered 750,000 civilian dead during and after the war due to famine caused by the [[blockade of Germany|Allied blockade]]. [[Russia]] and [[Turkey]] suffered civilian casualties in the millions.&lt;ref name=neiberg_pp68-70/&gt;

==World War II==
{{see also|World War II casualties}}
According to most sources, World War II was the most lethal war in world history, with some 70 million killed in six years. The civilian to combatant fatality rate in [[World War II]] lies somewhere between 3:2 and 2:1, or from 60% to 67%.&lt;ref name=sadowski_p134&gt;Sadowski, p. 134. See the [[World War II casualties]] article for a detailed breakdown of casualties.&lt;/ref&gt; The high rate of civilian casualties in this war was due in part to the increasing lethality of strategic weapons, used to target enemy industrial or population centres, and famines caused by economic disruption. A substantial number of civilians in this war were also deliberately killed by the [[Axis Powers]] as a result of racial policies (for example, the [[Holocaust]]) or ethnic cleansing campaigns.&lt;ref name=neiberg_pp68-70&gt;Neiberg, Michael S. (2002): ''Warfare in World History'', [http://books.google.com/books?id=PLQ9N1f7HnAC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=%22civilian+casualties%22+%22world+war+i%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=c50ATabrFs2HcbmYxasH&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=28&amp;ved=0CLMBEOgBMBs#v=onepage&amp;q=%22civilian%20casualties%22%20%22world%20war%20i%22&amp;f=false pp. 68-70], Routledge, ISBN 978-0415229548.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Korean War==
The median total estimated Korean civilian deaths in the [[Korean War]] is 1,547,000. The median total estimated Korean military deaths is 429,827. The civilian-combatant death ratio among Korean casualties is 36:10.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/warstat2.htm Twentieth Century Atlas&amp;nbsp;? Death Tolls]. Users.erols.com. Retrieved on 2010-11-29.&lt;/ref&gt; One source estimates that 20% of the total population of North Korea perished in the war.&lt;ref name=deane_p149&gt;Deane, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vietnam War==
The Vietnamese government has estimated the number of Vietnamese civilians killed in the war at two million, and the number of [[North Vietnamese Army|NVA]] and [[Viet Cong]] killed at 1.1 million&amp;nbsp;? estimates which approximate those of a number of other sources.&lt;ref name=shenon&gt;[http://www.virtual.vietnam.ttu.edu/star/images/232/2322414020.pdf &quot;20 Years After Victory&quot;], Philip Shenon, clipping from the Vietnam Center and Archive website.&lt;/ref&gt; This would give a civilian-combatant fatality rate of approximately 2:1, or about 65%. These figures do not include civilians killed in [[Cambodia]] and [[Laos]].

==1982 Lebanon War==
In 1981, the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization|PLO]] in [[Lebanon]] began shelling villages in northern Israel. In 1982, [[Israel]] mounted its [[1982 Lebanon War|response]].&lt;ref name=&quot; Sorenson&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last= Sorenson|first=David S. |title=Global Security Watch--Lebanon: A Reference Handbook|year=2010|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|isbn=9780313365782|pages=22???23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The war culminated in a seven-week long Israeli naval, air and artillery bombardment of Lebanon's capital, [[Beirut]], where the PLO had retreated. The bombardment eventually came to an end with an internationally brokered settlement in which the PLO forces were given safe passage to evacuate the country.&lt;ref name=hartley_pp91-92&gt;Hartley ''et all'', pp. 91-92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mattar_p47/&gt;

According to the [[International Red Cross]], by the end of the first week of the war alone, some 10,000 people, including 2,000 combatants, had been killed, and 16,000 wounded?a civilian-combatant fatality rate of 5:1.&lt;ref name=layoun_p134&gt;Layoun ''et al'', p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Lebanese government sources later estimated that by the end of the siege of Beirut, a total of about 18,000 had been killed, an estimated 85% of whom were civilians.&lt;ref name=mattar_p47&gt;Mattar, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hartley_p91&gt;Hartley ''et al'', p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; This would give a civilian-combatant fatality ratio of about 7:1.

==Chechen wars==
During the [[First Chechen War]], 4,000 separatist fighters and 40,000 civilians are estimated to have died, giving a civilian-combatant ratio of 10:1. The numbers for the [[Second Chechen War]] are 3,000 fighters and 13,000 civilians, for a ratio of 43:10. The combined ratio for both wars is 76:10. Casualty numbers for the conflict are notoriously unreliable. The estimates of the civilian casualties during the First Chechen war range from 20,000 to 100,000, with remaining numbers being similarly unreliable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Christoph | last = Z?rcher |author-link=Christoph Zuercher| title = The post-Soviet wars: rebellion, ethnic conflict, and nationhood in the Caucasus | page = 100 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=C0DTtKEktdEC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tactics employed by Russian forces in both wars were heavily criticized by human rights groups, which accused them of indiscriminate bombing and shelling of civilian areas and other crimes.&lt;ref name=hrw1996&gt;[http://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1996/WR96/Helsinki-16.htm &quot;Russian Federation - Human Rights Developments&quot;], [[Human Rights Watch]] report, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.amnesty.org/web/ar2001.nsf/webeurcountries/RUSSIAN+Federation?OpenDocument Russian Federation 2001 Report] [[Amnesty International]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==NATO in Yugoslavia==
{{see also|Civilian casualties during Operation Allied Force}}

In 1999, [[NATO]] intervened in the [[Kosovo War]] with a bombing campaign against Yugoslav forces, who were alleged to be conducting a campaign of [[ethnic cleansing]]. The bombing lasted about 2? months, until forcing the withdrawal of the Yugoslav army from Kosovo.

Estimates for the number of casualties caused by the bombing vary widely depending on the source. NATO unofficially claimed a toll of 5,000 enemy combatants killed by the bombardment; the Yugoslav government, on the other hand, gave a figure of 638 of its security forces killed in Kosovo.&lt;ref name=larson_p71&gt;Larson, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates for the civilian toll are similarly disparate. [[Human Rights Watch]] counted approximately 500 civilians killed by the bombing; the Yugoslav government estimated between 1,200 and 5,000.&lt;ref name=larson_p65&gt;Larson, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

If the NATO figures are to be believed, the bombings achieved a civilian to combatant kill ratio of about 1:10, on the Yugoslav government's figures, conversely, the ratio would be between 4:1 and 10:1. If the most conservative estimates from the sources cited above are used, the ratio was around 1:1.

According to military historian and Israeli Ambassador to the United States [[Michael Oren]], for every [[Serbia]]n soldier killed by [[NATO]] in 1999 (the period in which [[Operation Allied Force]] took place), four civilians died, a civilian to combatant casualty ratio of 4:1. Oren cites this figure as evidence that &quot;even the most moral army can make mistakes, especially in dense urban warfare&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Oren, [http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2009/09/24/un_report_a_victory_for_terror/ UN report a victory for terror], Boston Globe 24-09-2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coalition forces in the Iraq War==
{{see also|Casualties of the Iraq War}}
According to a 2010 assessment by John Sloboda of [[Iraq Body Count]], a United Kingdom-based organization, American and Coalition forces had killed at least 22,668 combatants as well as 13,807 civilians in the [[Iraq War]], indicating an essential civilian to combatant casualty ratio of 1:2.&lt;ref name=katz&gt;Yaakov Katz, [http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?ID=193196&amp;R=R1 Analysis: Lies, leaks, death tolls &amp; statistics], Jerusalem Post 29-10-2010&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear what percentage of civilians were killed in the initial (conventional war) invasion, as opposed to the percentage killed in the insurgency since.

==US drone strikes in Pakistan==
The civilian casualty rate for [[Drone attacks in Pakistan|U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan]] is notoriously difficult to quantify. The U.S. itself puts the number of civilians killed from drone strikes in the last two years at no more than 20 to 30, a total that is far too low according to a spokesman for the [[NGO]] [[Campaign for Innocent Victims in Conflict|CIVIC]].&lt;ref name=mcclatchy_10dec2010&gt;[http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2010/12/10/105104/pakistanis-protest-civilian-deaths.html?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_term=news &quot;Pakistanis protest civilian deaths in U.S. drone attacks&quot;], Saeed Shah, mcclatchy.com, 2010-12-10.&lt;/ref&gt; At the other extreme, Daniel L. Byman of the [[Brookings Institution]] suggests that drone strikes may kill &quot;10 or so civilians&quot; for every militant killed, which would represent a civilian to combatant casualty ratio of 10:1. Byman argues that civilian killings constitute a humanitarian tragedy and create dangerous political problems, including damage to the legitimacy of the Pakistani government and alienation of the Pakistani populace from America.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel L. Byman, [http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2009/0714_targeted_killings_byman.aspx?p=1 Do Targeted Killings Work?], Brookings 14-07-2009&lt;/ref&gt; A study by the [[New America Foundation]] in February estimated that between 830 and 1,210 civilians in total have been killed by drone strikes since 2004, a civilian fatality rate of about 30%, or 1:2.&lt;ref name=dawn_9may2010&gt;[http://news.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/the-newspaper/front-page/19-civilian-deaths-in-drone-attacks-debate-heats-up-950-hh-11 &quot;Civilian deaths in drone attacks: debate heats up&quot;], Cyril Almeida, news.dawn.com, 2010-05-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Israeli?Palestinian conflict==
The head of the [[Shin Bet]] reported to the Israeli Cabinet that of the 810 Palestinians killed in Gaza in 2006 and 2007, 200 were civilians (a ratio of approximately 1:3). ''[[Haaretz]]'' assessed this to be an underestimation of civilian casualties. Using [[B'tselem]]'s figures they calculated that 816 Palestinians had been killed in Gaza during the the two year period, 360 of whom were civilians.&lt;ref name=HzBR&gt;{{cite news

==Israeli airstrikes on militants in the Gaza Strip==
The civilian casualty rate of the targeted assassinations was surveyed by ''[[Haaretz]]'' military journalist Amos Harel. In 2002 and 2003, the ratio was 1:1, meaning one civilian killed for every militant killed. Harel called this period &quot;the dark days&quot; because of the relatively high civilian death toll as compared to later years. He attributed this to an [[Israeli Air Force]] (IAF) practice of attacking militants even when they were located in densely populated areas. While there were always safety rules, argued Harel, these were &quot;bent&quot; at times in view of the target's importance.&lt;ref name=pin&gt;Amos Harel, [http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/pinpoint-attacks-on-gaza-more-precise-1.236163 Pinpoint attacks on Gaza more precise], Haaretz (unknown date)&lt;/ref&gt;

The civilian casualty ratio dropped steeply to 1:28 in late 2005, meaning one civilian killed for every 28 militants killed. Harel credited this drop to the new IAF chief [[Eliezer Shkedi]]'s policies. The ratio rose again in 2006 to 1:10, a fact that Harel blamed on &quot;several IAF mishaps&quot;. However, in 2007 and 2008 the ratio dropped to an unprecedented level of less than 1:30, or 2?3 percent of the total casualties being civilian.&lt;ref name=pin/&gt; Figures showing an improvement from 1:1 in 2002 to 1:30 in 2008 were also cited by ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'' journalist Yaakov Katz.&lt;ref name=katz/&gt;

Professor [[Alan Dershowitz]] of [[Harvard Law School]] stated that the 2008 figure of 1:30 represents the lowest civilian to combatant casualty ratio in history in the setting of combating terrorism. Dershowitz criticized the international media and human rights organizations for not taking sufficient note of it. He also argued that even this figure may be misleading because not all civilians are innocent bystanders.&lt;ref name=dersh&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alan-dershowitz/targeted-killing-is-worki_b_79616.html,|title=Targeted Killing Is Working, So Why Is The Press Not Reporting It?|last=Dershowitz|first=Alan|date=January 3, 2008|work=[[The Huffington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, Dershowitz stated that the ratio for Israel's campaign of targeted assassinations stood at 1 civilian for every 28 terrorists. He argued that &quot;this is the best ratio of any country in the world that is fighting asymmetrical warfare against terrorists who hide behind civilians. It is far better than the ratio achieved by Great Britain and the United States in Iraq or Afghanistan, where both nations employ targeted killings of terrorist leaders.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Dershowitz, [http://www.hudson-ny.org/848/the-hypocrisy-of-universal-jurisdiction The Hypocrisy of &quot;Universal Jurisdiction&quot;], Hudson Institute 06-10-2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Testifying before the United Nations, Col. Richard Kemp, a British commander, stated that:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unwatch.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=bdKKISNqEmG&amp;b=1313923&amp;ct=7536409&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Mr. President, based on my knowledge and experience, I can say this: During Operation Cast Lead, the Israeli Defence Forces did more to safeguard the rights of civilians in a combat zone than any other army in the history of warfare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Israel did so while facing an enemy that deliberately positioned its military capability behind the human shield of the civilian population... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The truth is that the IDF took extraordinary measures to give Gaza civilians notice of targeted areas, dropping over 2 million leaflets, and making over 100,000 phone calls. Many missions that could have taken out Hamas military capability were aborted to prevent civilian casualties. During the conflict, the IDF allowed huge amounts of humanitarian aid into Gaza. To deliver aid virtually into your enemy's hands is, to the military tactician, normally quite unthinkable. But the IDF took on those risks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Despite all of this, of course innocent civilians were killed. War is chaos and full of mistakes. There have been mistakes by the British, American and other forces in Afghanistan and in Iraq, many of which can be put down to human error. But mistakes are not war crimes... &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
More than anything, the civilian casualties were a consequence of Hamas way of fighting. Hamas deliberately tried to sacrifice their own civilians.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although the IDF has the lowest ratio in the world, they attribute&lt;ref&gt;http://www.idfblog.com/2012/03/11/bombing-gaza-or-pinpoint-strikes/&lt;/ref&gt; civilian deaths to [[Hamas#Children_as_human_shields|Hamas' use of human shields]], as well as other groups in Gaza that use human shields.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.idfblog.com/hamas/category/hamas-terror/human-shield/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas#Children_as_human_shields&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=171009&lt;/ref&gt;

The IDF blog lists various counter-terrorism methods used by the IDF to minimize civilian casualties and lower the civilian casualty ratio, and includes videos related to each method:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.idfblog.com/2012/03/11/bombing-gaza-or-pinpoint-strikes/&lt;/ref&gt;

* Pinpoint targeting - singling out terrorists for an airstrike in a way that won't harm civilian bystanders.
* Aborting strikes due to risk of civilians being injured or killed.
* Advanced technology - the IDF has heavily invested in smart bombs&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesofisrael.com/iron-dome-the-newly-beloved-missile-defense-system-that-nobody-wanted/&lt;/ref&gt;, and has developed special missiles, such as the [[F-16_Fighting_Falcon_variants#F-16I_Sufa|F-16I Sufa]] and the [http://www.idfblog.com/2012/01/19/5-more-incredible-technologies-used-by-the-idf/ Delilah Missile], which has the ability to cancel a strike while in the air.

==Israel in the Gaza War==
{{see also|Casualties of the Gaza War}}
Several analysts have attempted to calculate the [[Israel Defense Force]]'s civilian casualty ratio in Operation Cast Lead during the [[Gaza War]]. All have noted that the ratio differs significantly depending on which figures are used regarding the total number of casualties and their identity. The main sets of figures are those published by the IDF, essentially corroborated by [[Hamas]], the opposing belligerent in the conflict, on the one hand; and those published by [[B'Tselem]] on the other hand.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/hamas-admits-600-700-of-its-men-were-killed-in-cast-lead-1.323776 and http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20101101/wl_mideast_afp/israelpalestiniansconflictgazahamastoll&lt;/ref&gt;  The final IDF report identified 709 militants out of a total of 1,161 Gaza fatalities, with another 162 whose status could not be confirmed (300 were ID'd as civilians).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Majority of Palestinians Killed in Operation Cast Lead: Terror Operatives,&quot; IDF Research Department, http://dover.idf.il/IDF/English/News/today/09/03/2602.htm, also see Ben-Dror Yemini's article translated from Maariv, &quot;How Many Civilians Were Killed in Gaza?&quot; at http://www.solomonia.com/blog/archive/2009/07/ben-dror-yemini-how-many-civilians-were/index.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist Yaakov Katz states in ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'' that the ratio is 1:3 according to the Israeli figures and 60% civilians (3:2) according to B'Tselem's figures. Katz attributes the IDF's low ratio in the Gaza War and in the year preceding it to Israel's investment in special weapons systems, including small [[smart bomb]]s that minimize collateral damage, and to an upscaled Israeli effort to warn civilians to flee areas and to divert missiles at the last moment if civilians entered a planned strike zone. Katz notes that over 81 percent of the 5,000 missiles the IDF dropped in the Gaza Strip during the operation were smart bombs, a percentage which he states is unprecedented in modern warfare.&lt;ref name=katz/&gt;

Journalist and commentator Evelyn Gordon writes in ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'' that the civilian casualty ratio in Operation Cast Lead was 39 percent (2:3), using however only the preliminary Israeli estimates, but that 56 or 74 percent were civilians according to B'Tselem's figures, depending on whether 248 Hamas policemen are considered combatants or civilians; and 65 or 83 percent according to the figures of the [[Palestinian Centre for Human Rights]]. Gordon notes that all of these ratios, even if the worse were correct, are lower than the normal civilian-to-combatant wartime fatality ratio in wars elsewhere, as given by the Red Cross, and states that the comparison shows that the IDF was unusually successful at minimizing civilian casualty rates. She concludes by charging that terrorists fight from among civilians because they know that the inevitable civilian casualties will result in opprobrium for their victims who dare to fight back, and that this norm will not change as long as this modus operandi remains profitable.&lt;ref&gt;Evelyn Gordon, [http://www.commentarymagazine.com/blogs/index.php/evelyn-gordon/377631 WikiLeaks and the Gaza War], Commentary 25-10-2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Colonel [[Richard Kemp]], former Commander of British Forces in Afghanistan, spoke in 2011 about Israeli operations in the Gaza War. He said that a study published by the United Nations showed &quot;that the ratio of civilian to combatant deaths in Gaza was by far the lowest in any asymmetric conflict in the history of warfare.&quot; He stated that this ratio was less than 1:1, and compared it favorably to the estimated ratios in NATO operations in Afghanistan (3:1), western campaigns in Iraq and Kosovo (believed to be 4:1), and the conflicts in Chechnya and Serbia (much higher than 4:1, according to anecdotal evidence). Kemp argued that the low ratio was achieved through unprecedented measures by the IDF to minimize civilian casualties, which included providing warnings to the population via telephone calls, radio broadcasts and leaflets, as well as granting pilots the discretion to abort a strike if they perceived too great a risk of civilian casualties. He also stated that the civilian casualties that did occur could be seen in light of [[Hamas]]' tactical use of Gazan civilians &quot;as human shields, to hide behind, to stand between Israeli forces and their own fighters&quot; and strategic use of them for exploitation of their deaths in the media.&lt;ref name=kempjp&gt;Richard Kemp, [http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-EdContributors/Article.aspx?id=225172 A salute to the IDF], Jerusalem Post 15-06-2011&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The UN estimate that there has been an average three-to-one ratio of civilian to combatant deaths in such conflicts worldwide. Three civilians for every combatant killed.

That is the estimated ratio in Afghanistan: three to one. In Iraq, and in Kosovo, it was worse: the ratio is believed to be four-to-one. Anecdotal evidence suggests the ratios were very much higher in Chechnya and Serbia.

In Gaza, it was less than one-to-one.?&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX6vyT8RzMo&lt;/ref&gt;

Armed violence reduction
</title>
<id>

</id>
<text>
The concept of '''armed violence reduction (AVR)''' has gained significant in importance after the [[Geneva Declaration on Armed Violence and Development|2006 Geneva Declaration on Armed Violence and Development]]. According to [[OECD]], more than 740,000 people die each year as a result of the violence associated with [[armed conflict]]s and large- and small-scale [[criminality]]. Furthermore, armed violence impedes humanitarian and socio-economic development and, hence, it is an obstruction to achieving the [[Millennium Development Goals|Millennium Development Goals (MDG)]].== Key numbers on armed violence from the Geneva Declaration on Armed Violence and Development ==

* More than 740,000 people have died directly or indirectly from armed violence - both conflict and [[violent crime|criminal violence]] - every year in recent years.
* More than 540,000 of these deaths are violent, with the vast majority occurring in non-conflict settings.
* At least 200,000 people - and perhaps many thousands more - have died each year in conflict zones from non-violent causes (such as [[malnutrition]], [[dysentery]], or other easily preventable diseases) that resulted from the effects of war on populations.
* Between 2004 and 2007, at least 208,300 violent deaths were recorded in armed conflicts - an average of 52,000 people killed per year. This is a conservative estimate including only recorded deaths: the real total may be much higher.
* The annual economic cost of armed violence in non-conflict settings, in terms of lost [[productivity]] due to violent deaths, is [[USD]] 95 billion and could reach as high as USD 163 billion - 0.14 percent of the annual [[global GDP|global]] [[GDP]].&lt;ref&gt;Geneva Declaration key numbers: http://www.genevadeclaration.org/fileadmin/docs/Geneva-Declaration-Millennium-Development-Goals.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Armed violence reduction is therefore essential for the achievement of the Millenium Development Goals.

War profiteering
</title>
<id>

</id>
<text>
{{TOC right}}{{refimprove|date=November 2009}}A '''war profiteer''' is any person or organization that [[Profit (economics)|profits]] from [[war]]fare or by selling [[weapon]]s and other goods to parties at war. The term has strong negative connotations. General [[profiteering (business)|profiteering]] may also occur in peace time.

==Types==
===International arms dealers===
Others make their money by cooperating with the authorities. [[Basil Zaharoff]]'s  [[Vickers]] Company sold weapons to all the parties involved in the [[Chaco War]]. Companies like [[Opel]] and [[History of IBM|IBM]] have been labeled war profiteers for their involvement with the [[Third Reich]].

===Commodity dealers===
War usually leads to a shortage in the supply of [[Commodity|commodities]], which results in higher prices and higher revenues.

===Politicians===
Political figures taking bribes and favors from corporations involved with war production have been called war profiteers. [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s first [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]], [[Simon Cameron]], was forced to resign in early 1862 after charges of corruption relating to war contracts. In 1947, Kentucky congressman [[Andrew J. May]], Chairman of the powerful [[United States House Committee on Armed Services|Committee on Military Affairs]], was convicted for taking bribes in exchange for war contracts.

===Civilian contractors===
More recently, companies involved with supplying the coalition forces in the [[Iraq War]], such as [[Bechtel]], [[KBR]], [[Blackwater USA|Blackwater]] and [[Halliburton]], have come under fire for allegedly overcharging for their services.&lt;ref&gt;

===Military contractors===
Groups that potentially profit from war, or the threat of war, are [[Defense contractor|military contractors]] like [[Lockheed Martin]], [[Boeing]], [[Northrop Grumman]], [[Raytheon]] and [[General Dynamics]], to name a few. Old military material has to be discarded due to age or is lost due to fighting and new and different military material is needed by the military to maintain strategic advantages over the military technologies of foreign nations which are hostile or may become hostile.

===Black marketeers===
A distinction can be made between war profiteers who gain by sapping military strength and those who gain by contributing to the war. For instance, during and after [[World War II]], enormous profits were available by selling rationed goods like [[cigarette]]s, [[chocolate]], [[coffee]] and [[butter]] on the [[black market]]. Dishonest military personnel given oversight over valuable property sometimes diverted rationed goods to the black market. The charge could also be laid against medical and legal professionals who accept money in exchange for helping young men evade a draft.

==Anti-profiteering measures==

Making unreasonable profits from war is widely considered unethical and is deeply unpopular, so attempts to prohibit excessive war profiteering, such as the imposition of an [[excess profits tax]], receive much political support in wartime.  Defining 'excessive' accurately is difficult, however, and such legislation frequently allows some instances of profiteering to go unchecked while reducing the income of others' war-related business to loss-making levels.

==In the United States==
Criticism of companies such as [[Halliburton]] in the context of the [[Iraq war]] draw heavily on the stereotype of the businessman profiteer. Slogans relating to 'blood for oil' have a similar implication.

[[Steve Clemons]], a senior fellow at the [[New America Foundation]] [[think tank]], has accused former CIA Director [[R. James Woolsey, Jr.|James Woolsey]] of both profiting from and promoting the [[Iraq War]].&lt;ref&gt;

The [[Center for Public Integrity]] has reported that US Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]] and her husband, [[Richard Blum]], are making millions of dollars from Iraq and Afghanistan contracts through his company, [[Perini]].&lt;ref&gt;

Indicted defense contractor [[Brent R. Wilkes]] was reported to be ecstatic when hearing that the United States was going to go to war with Iraq. ?He and some of his top executives were really gung-ho about the war,? said a former employee. ?Brent said this would create new opportunities for the company. He was really excited about doing business in the Middle East.?&lt;ref&gt;

Major General [[Smedley Butler]], USMC, criticized war profiteering of U.S companies during World War I in ''[[War Is a Racket]]''. He wrote about how some companies and corporations increase their earnings and profits by up to 1700% and how many companies willingly sold equipment and supplies to the U.S that had no relevant use in the war effort. In the book, Butler stated that &quot;It has been estimated by statisticians and economists and researchers that the war cost your Uncle Sam $52,000,000,000. Of this sum, $39,000,000,000 was expended in the actual war period. This expenditure Yielded $16,000,000,000 in profits.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The term 'war profiteer' evokes two stereotypes in popular culture: the rich businessman who sells weapons to governments, and the semi-criminal [[black market]]eer who sells goods to ordinary citizens. In English-speaking countries this is particularly associated with Britain during [[World War II]]. The image of the 'businessman profiteer' carries the implication of influence and power used to actively cause wars for personal gain, rather than merely passively profit from them. In the aftermath of [[World War I]], such profiteers were widely asserted to have existed by both the Left, and the  Right.

Fictional character Lieutenant [[Milo Minderbinder]] in the novel ''[[Catch-22]]'' has been called &quot;perhaps the best known of all fictional profiteers&quot; in American literature.&lt;ref name=&quot;warhogs&quot;&gt;Stuart Dean Brandes: ''Warhogs: a history of war profits in America''. University Press of Kentucky, 1997, ISBN 0-8131-2020-9, pg. 273&lt;/ref&gt;

The surname of the character 'Daddy Warbucks' in [[Little Orphan Annie]] carries an obvious implication. This character is interesting for being an example of the stereotype of a war profiteer applied to a 'good guy'.

The [[The Adventures of Tintin|Tintin]] adventure [[The Broken Ear]] features an arms dealer called [[Basil Bazarov]] who sells arms to both sides in a  war. He is a recognisable example of this 'type', and specifically based on [[Basil Zaharoff]].

The character of Joe Walker in the sitcom [[Dad's Army]] is an example of the second stereotype of a war profiteer while the character Rick Pym in the novel [[A Perfect Spy]] is a more psychologically complex example.

[[Brecht]] wrote the play [[Mother Courage and Her Children]] as a didactic indictment of war profiteering.

In the 1985 film [[Clue (film)|Clue]], Colonel Mustard was a war profiteer who sold stolen radio components on the black market.

The film ''[[The Third Man]]'' features a war profiteer named Harry Lime, who steals penicillin from military hospitals and sells it on the black market.

The film ''[[Lord of War]]'' is a fictional story based on the war profiteer named [[Viktor Bout]], who illegally sold post-Soviet arms to Liberia and other nations in conflict.

[[The Suicide Machines]] released their 2005 album, entitled ''[[War Profiteering Is Killing Us All]]''.

{{Other uses}}{{Redirect|Avenger of blood|the biblical and Jewish concepts|Goel}}
A '''feud''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|?|f|ju?|d}}), referred to in more extreme cases as a '''blood feud''', '''vendetta''', '''faida''', or '''private war''', is a long-running argument or fight between parties?often groups of people, especially families or [[clan]]s. Feuds begin because one party (correctly or incorrectly) perceives itself to have been attacked, insulted or wronged by another. Intense feelings of [[resentment]] trigger the initial [[Retributive justice|retribution]], which causes the other party to feel equally aggrieved and [[revenge|vengeful]]. The dispute is subsequently fuelled by a long-running cycle of retaliatory [[violence]]. This continual cycle of provocation and retaliation makes it extremely difficult to end the feud peacefully. Feuds frequently involve the original parties' family members and/or associates, can last for [[generation]]s and may result in extreme acts of [[violence]]. They can be interpreted as an extreme outgrowth of social relations based in [[family honor]].

Until the [[early modern period]], feuds were considered legitimate legal instruments &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manaraefan.co.uk/index_files/Page3400.htm Revenue, Lordship, Kinship &amp; Law&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and were regulated to some degree.  Montenegrin culture calls this ''krvna osveta'' which means &quot;blood revenge&quot; which had unspoken but highly valued rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boehm|first=Christopher|title=Blood Revenge: The Anthropology of Fueding in Montenegro and Other Tribal Societies|year=1984|publisher=The University of Kansas|location=Lawrence, Kansas|isbn=0-7006-0245-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Redirect|Blood feud|other uses|Blood Feud (disambiguation)}}
A '''blood feud''' is a feud with a cycle of retaliatory violence, with the relatives of someone who has been killed or otherwise wronged or [[honor|dishonored]] seeking vengeance by killing or otherwise physically punishing the culprits or their relatives. Historically, the word '''''vendetta''''' has been used to mean a blood feud. The word is [[Italian language|Italian]], and originates from the [[Latin]] ''vindicta'' (''[[wikt:vengeance|vengeance]]''). In modern times, the word is sometimes extended to mean any other long-standing feud, not necessarily involving bloodshed. Sometimes, it is not mutual but a prolonged series of hostile acts waged by one person against another without reciprocation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cheetah.eb.com/dictionary/vendetta Merriam-Webster]&lt;/ref&gt;
===Vendetta history===

Originally, a vendetta was a blood feud between two families where kinsmen of the victim intended to avenge his or her death by killing either those responsible for the killing or some of their relatives. The responsibility to maintain the vendetta usually falls on the closest male relative to whoever has been killed or wronged, but other members of the family may take the mantle as well. If the culprit had disappeared or was already dead, the vengeance could extend to other relatives.

[[File:LockInTower.jpg|thumb|200px|left|A fortified tower used as refuge for men involved in a blood feud that are vulnerable to attack. Thethi, northern [[Albania]].]]

Vendetta is common in societies with a weak rule of law (or where the state doesn't consider itself responsible for mediating this kind of dispute) where family and kinship ties are the main source of [[authority]]. An entire family is considered responsible for whatever one of them has done. Sometimes even two separate branches of the same family could come to blows over some matter.

The practice has mostly disappeared with more centralized societies where law enforcement and [[criminal law]] take responsibility of punishing lawbreakers.

In ancient [[Homeric]] Greece, the practice of personal vengeance against wrongdoers was considered natural and customary: &quot;Embedded in the Greek morality of retaliation is the right of vendetta . . . Vendetta is a war, just as war is an indefinite series of vendettas; and such acts of vengeance are sanctioned by the gods&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=John Gwyn |last=Griffiths |title=Divine Verdict: A Study of Divine Judgement in the Ancient Religions |year=1991 |page=90 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=900409231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ancient Hebraic context, it was considered the duty of the individual and family to avenge evil on behalf of God. The executor of the law of blood-revenge who personally put the initial killer to death was given a special designation: ''go'el haddam'', the blood-avenger or blood-redeemer ([[Book of Numbers]] 35: 19, etc.). Six [[cities of refuge]] were established to provide protection and due process for any unintentional manslayers. The avenger was forbidden from harming the unintentional killer if the killer took refuge in one of these cities. As the ''Oxford Companion to the Bible'' states: &quot;Since life was viewed as sacred ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 9.6), no amount of [[blood money (term)|blood money]] could be given as recompense for the loss of the life of an innocent person; it had to be [[lex talionis|'life for life']]&quot; ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 21.23; [[Deuteronomy]] 19.21)&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Oxford Companion to the Bible |first1=Bruce M. |last1=Metzger |first2=Michael D. |last2=Coogan |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1993 |page=68 |isbn=0-19-504645-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
The [[Middle Ages]], from beginning to end, and particularly the [[feudal]] era, lived under the sign of private [[revenge|vengeance]]. The onus, of course, lay above all on the wronged individual; vengeance was imposed on him as the most sacred of duties ... The solitary individual, however, could do but little. Moreover, it was most commonly a death that had to be avenged. In this case the family group went into action and the ''faide'' (feud) came into being, to use the old Germanic word which spread little by little through the whole of Europe--'the vengeance of the kinsmen which we call ''faida''', as a German canonist expressed it. No moral obligation seemed more sacred than this ... The whole kindred, therefore, placed as a rule under the command of a [[chieftain]], took up arms to punish the murder of one of its members or merely a wrong that he had suffered.

The blood feud has certain similarities to the ritualized warfare found in many primitive tribes. Thus, for instance, more than a third of the [[Ya?nomam?]] males, on average, died from [[Prehistoric warfare|warfare]]. The accounts of missionaries to the area have recounted constant infighting in the tribes for women or prestige, and evidence of continuous warfare for the [[enslavement]] of neighboring tribes such as the [[Macu tribe|Macu]] before the arrival of European settlers and government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keeley&quot;&gt;Keeley: ''[[War Before Civilization|War before civilization: The myth of the peaceful savage]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Japan]]'s feudal past the [[Samurai]] class upheld the honor of their family, clan, or their lord by ''katakiuchi'' ({{lang|ja|???}}), or revenge killings. These killings could also involve the relatives of an offender. While some vendettas were punished by the government, such as that of the [[Forty-seven Ronin]], others were given official permission with specific targets.

At the [[Holy Roman Empire]]'s ''[[Reichstag (Holy Roman Empire)|Reichstag]]'' at [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] in 1495 the right of waging feuds was abolished. The [[Imperial Reform]] proclaimed an &quot;eternal [[public peace]]&quot; (''Ewiger Landfriede'') to put an end to the abounding feuds and the anarchy of the [[robber baron]]s and it defined a new standing imperial army to enforce that peace. However, it took a few more decades until the new regulation was universally accepted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nndb.com/people/399/000096111/ Maximilian I]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1506, for example, knight Jan Kopidlansky killed a family rival in [[Prague]] and the Town Councillors sentenced him to death and had him executed. Brother Jiri Kopidlansky revenged himself by continuing atrocities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/Slavonic/Czech_Hist6.html The State of the Estates]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Greece the custom of blood feud is found in several parts of the country, for instance in Crete and Mani. Throughout history, the [[Maniots]] have been known by their neighbors and their enemies as fearless [[warrior]]s who practice [[Maniots#Vendettas|blood feuds]], known in the Maniot dialect of Greek as &quot;????????&quot; (Gdikiomo). Some vendettas went on for months and sometimes years. The families involved would lock themselves in their towers and when they got the chance would murder members of the opposing family. The Maniot vendetta is considered the most vicious and ruthless; it has led to entire family lines being wiped out. The last vendetta on record required the [[Greek Army]] with [[artillery]] support to force it to a stop. Regardless of this, the Maniot Greeks still practice vendettas even today. Maniots in [[United States|America]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and [[Corsica]] in [[France]] still have on-going vendettas which have led to the creation of [[Mafia]] families known as &quot;?????????&quot; (Gdikiomeoi).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mani.org.gr/en/history/venteta.htm Vendetta]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vathia Mani Greece.jpg|thumb|220px|Vathia, a typical Maniot village famous for its towers]]

In [[Corsica]], vendetta was a social code that required Corsicans to kill anyone who wronged the family honor. Between 1821 and 1852, no less than 4,300 murders were perpetrated in Corsica.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=udhEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA196&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Wanderings in Corsica: its history and its heroes]''&quot;. Ferdinand Gregorovius (1855). p.196.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]] in the [[Late Middle Ages]] was ravaged by bitter partisan wars between local ruling families. In [[Navarre]], these conflicts became polarised in a violent struggle between the Agramont and Beaumont parties. In [[Biscay]], the two major warring factions were named Oinaz and Gamboa. (''Cf.'' the [[Guelphs]] and [[Ghibellines]] in Italy). High defensive structures (&quot;towers&quot;) built by local noble families, few of which survive today, were frequently razed by fires, sometimes by royal decree.

Leontiy Lyulye, an expert on conditions in the [[Caucasus]], wrote in the mid-19th century: &quot;Among the [[Peoples of the Caucasus|mountain people]] the blood feud is not an uncontrollable permanent feeling such as the vendetta is among the Corsicans. It is more like an obligation imposed by the public opinion.&quot; In the [[Dagestan]]i [[aul]] Kadar, one such blood feud between two antagonistic clans lasted for nearly 260 years, from the 17th century till the 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peaceinthecaucasus.org/background/bg_society.htm Chechen society and mentality], Dr. Emil Souleimanov&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Celts|Celtic]] phenomenon of the ''blood feud'' demanded &quot;an eye for an eye,&quot; and usually descended into murder. Disagreements between [[clan]]s might last for generations in [[Scotland]] and [[Ireland]]. The [[Clan Gordon]] was at one point one of the most powerful [[Scottish clan|clans]] in middle [[Scotland]]. Clan feuds and battles were frequent, especially with the [[Clan Cameron]], [[Clan Murray]], [[Clan Forbes]], and the [[Chattan Confederation]].

Due to the Celtic heritage of many whites living in [[Appalachia]], a series of prolonged violent engagements in late- nineteenth-century [[Kentucky]] and [[West Virginia]] were referred to commonly as feuds, a tendency that was partly due to the nineteenth-century popularity of [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Sir Walter Scott]], both of whom wrote semihistorical accounts of blood feuds. These incidents, the most famous of which was the [[Hatfield-McCoy feud]], were regularly featured in the newspapers of the eastern U.S. between the Reconstruction era and the early twentieth century, and are seen by some as linked to a [[Southern culture of honor]] with its roots in the [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] forebears of the residents of the area.&lt;ref&gt;[[Malcolm Gladwell]], &quot;Outliers&quot; (2008), Chapter 6, citing, for example, David Hackett Fischer, &quot;Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt; Another prominent example is the [[Regulator-Moderator War]], which took place between rival factions in the [[Republic of Texas]]. It is sometimes considered the largest blood feud in American history.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.texasescapes.com/AllThingsHistorical/The-Worst-Feud-BB1006.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative to feud was ''[[blood money (term)|blood money]]'' (or ''[[weregild]]'' in the  [[Norsemen|Norse]] culture), which demanded payment of some kind from those responsible for a wrongful death (even an accidental one). If these payments were not made or were refused by the offended party, a blood feud would ensue.

===Vendetta in modern times===

In [[Albania]], the blood feud has returned in rural areas after more than 40 years of being abolished by Albanian communists led by [[Enver Hoxha]]. More than 5,500 Albanian families are currently engaged in blood feuds. There are now more than 20,000 men and boys who live under an ever-present death sentence because of blood feuds. Since 1992, at least 10,000 [[Albanians]] have been killed due to blood feuds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0625/p01s02-woeu.html Peacemaker breaks the ancient grip of Albania's blood feuds], csmonitor.com, June 24, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Mutual vendetta may develop into a vicious circle of further [[murder|killings]], retaliation, counterattacks, and all-out [[war]]fare that can end in the mutual extinction of both families. Often the original cause is forgotten, and feuds continue simply because it is perceived that there has always been a feud.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Some of the [[gang]] wars between [[organized crime]] groups are effectively forms of vendetta, where the criminal organization (like the [[Mafia]] &quot;family&quot;) has taken the place of blood relatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/mar/18/usa.paulharris Gang mayhem grips LA], The Observer&lt;/ref&gt;

====Philippines====
Family and clan feuds, known locally as ''rido'', are characterized by sporadic outbursts of retaliatory violence between families and kinship groups, as well as between communities. It can occur in areas where the government or a central authority is weak as well as in areas where there is a perceived lack of justice and security. [[Rido]] is a [[Maranao language|Maranao]] term commonly used in [[Mindanao]] to refer to clan feuds. It is considered one of the major problems in Mindanao because apart from numerous casualties, rido has caused destruction of property, crippled the local economy, and displaced families.

Located in the southern Philippines, Mindanao is home to a majority of the country?s Muslim community and includes the [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]]. Mindanao is a region suffering from poor infrastructure, high poverty rates, and violence that has claimed the lives of more than 120,000 people in the last three decades. There is a widely held stereotype that the violence is perpetrated by armed groups that resort to terrorism to further their political goals, but the actual situation is far more complex. While the Muslim-Christian conflict and the state-rebel conflicts dominate popular perceptions and media attention, a survey commissioned by The Asia Foundation in 2002 and further verified by a recent [[Social Weather Stations]] survey revealed that citizens are more concerned about the prevalence of rido and its negative impact on their communities than the conflict between the state and rebel groups. The unfortunate interaction and subsequent confusion of rido-based violence with secessionism, communist insurgency, banditry, military involvement and other forms of armed violence shows that violence in Mindanao is more complicated than what is commonly believed.

Rido has wider implications for conflict in Mindanao primarily because it tends to interact in unfortunate ways with separatist conflict and other forms of armed violence.  Many armed confrontations in the past involving insurgent groups and the military were triggered by a local rido.  The studies cited below investigated the dynamics of rido with the intention of helping design strategic interventions to address such conflicts.

=====Causes=====
The causes of rido are varied and may be further complicated by a society?s concept of honor and shame, an integral aspect of the social rules that determine accepted practices in the affected communities. The trigger of conflicts range from petty offenses, such as theft and jesting, to more serious crimes, like homicide. These are further aggravated by land disputes and political rivalries, the most common causes of rido. Proliferation of firearms, lack of law enforcement and credible mediators in conflict-prone areas, and an inefficient justice system further contribute to instances of rido.

=====Statistics=====
Studies on rido have documented a total of 1,266 rido cases between the 1930s and 2005, which have killed over 5,500 people and displaced thousands. The four provinces with the highest numbers of rido incidences are: [[Lanao del Sur]] (377), [[Maguindanao]] (218), [[Lanao del Norte]] (164), and [[Sulu Province|Sulu]] (145). Incidences in these four provinces account for 71% of the total documented cases. The findings also show a steady rise in rido conflicts in the eleven provinces surveyed from the 1980s to 2004. According to the studies, during 2002-2004, 50% (637 cases) of total rido incidences occurred, equaling about 127 new rido cases per year. Out of the total number of rido cases documented, 64% remain unresolved.&lt;ref name=&quot;Torres, Wilfredo M 2007&quot;&gt;Torres, Wilfredo M (ed). 2007. ?Rido: Clan Feuding and Conflict Management in Mindanao.? Makati: The Asia Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Resolution=====
Rido conflicts are either resolved, unresolved, or reoccur. Although the majority of these cases remain unresolved, there have been many resolutions through different conflict-resolving bodies and mechanisms. These cases utilize the formal procedures of the Philippine government and/or the various indigenous systems. Formal methods may involve official courts, local government officials, police, and the military. Indigenous methods to resolve conflicts usually involve elder leaders who use local knowledge, beliefs, and practices, as well as their own personal influence, to help repair and restore damaged relationships. Some cases using this approach involve the payment of [[blood money (term)|blood money]] to resolve the conflict. Hybrid mechanisms include the collaboration of government, religious, and traditional leaders in resolving conflicts through the formation of collaborative groups.  Furthermore, the institutionalization of traditional conflict resolution processes into laws and ordinances has been successful with the hybrid method approach. Other conflict-resolution methods include the establishment of ceasefires and the intervention of youth organizations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Torres, Wilfredo M 2007&quot;/&gt;

Bavarian War (1459?1463)
</title>

<text>
The '''Bavarian War''' from 1459 to 1463, also known as the '''Princes War''', was a result of the expansionist ambitions of the two warring Principalities, pitting Margrave, later Elector, [[Albrecht III Achilles, Elector of Brandenburg|Albert Achilles]] from the [[House of Hohenzollern]], which by this time had already annexed the principalities of [[Brandenburg-Kulmbach]] and [[Brandenburg-Ansbach]], against Duke [[Louis IX, Duke of Bavaria|Louis &quot;the Rich&quot;]] of [[Bavaria-Landshut]] from the [[House of Wittelsbach]].== Background ==
[[File:Albrecht Achilles.jpg|thumb | Elector Albrecht Achilles, representation from the 16 Century]]
[[File:Ludwig der Reiche.jpg|thumb | Duke Louis the Rich, representation from the 16 Century]]
Albert Achilles tried to expand the jurisdiction of his courts, as part of his attempt to extend his influence over neighbouring areas.  For this purpose, he tried to raise his Burgraviate Court at [[Burgraviate of Nuremberg|Nuremberg]] to a [[Reichsgericht|Imperial Court]].  This would have given him jurisdiction over the neighbouring principalities and the possibility to override decisions of subordinate courts.  He also had in mind a plan to re-establish the [[Duchy of Franconia]], with himself as Duke.  The [[Bishopric of W?rzburg]] had similar plans; neither party managed to implement them.

The territory of Duke Louis the Rich of Bavaria-Landshut had recently grown considerably by the incorporation of [[Bavaria-Ingolstadt]].

== Alliances ==
Albert Achilles managed to make a credible case to Emperor [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick]] that the Hohenzollern interests in bavaria happened to coincide with the imperial interests.  After Louis the Rich had created a ''[[casus belli]]'' by taking the [[Free Imperial City]] of [[Donauw?rth]], the Emperor [[outlaw]]ed Louis and tasked Albert Achilles with implementing this verdict.

Both sides drew in allies with different interests and the conflict spread through southern and central Germany and even the [[Bohemia]]n King [[George of Pod?brady]] participated.

Among Albert Achilles's allies were Margrave [[Charles I, Margrave of Baden-Baden|Charles of Baden-Baden]], Count [[Ulrich V, Count of W?rttemberg|Ulrich V of W?rttemberg]], his brother Elector [[Frederick II, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick II of Brandenburg]], the [[Electorate of Mainz]], Duke [[William III, Duke of Saxony|William III of Saxony]] and Landgrave [[Louis II, Landgrave of Hesse|Louis II of Hesse]].   Among Louis's allies were Elector Palatine [[Frederick I, Elector Palatine|Frederick &quot;the Victorious&quot;]], also of the House of Wittelsbach, Count Palatine[[Otto I, Count Palatine of Mosbach|Otto I of Mosbach]] and the [[Prince-Bishop]]s [[Rudolf von Scherenberg]] of W?rzburg and [[Philip of Henneberg]] of Bamberg and later also the [[Bohemia]]n King [[George of Pod?brady]].

== Course of the war ==
In 1460, it looked like Louis had won: his army had penetrated deep into Albert Achilles's land and forced him to accept the transfer of territory known as the ''Judgement of Roth''.  Louis the Rich also attacked the [[Bishopric of Eichst?tt]] under Prince-Bishop [[John III of Eych]],

However, in 1461, Albert Achilles had enough allies on his side to be able to reject this judgement.  Louis the Rich was still stronger militarily and occupied more land in the Margraviate.  The emperor then intervened and tasked the King of Bohemia with negotiating a cease-fire in Prague.  Meanwhile, Louis continued to attack neutral cities.  He completely destroyed some of them.

Two important battles were fought in 1462: the [[Battle of Seckenheim]] in June 1462, where Louis's ally [[Frederick I, Elector Palatine|Frederick &quot;the Victorious&quot;]] managed to take the Imperial captains [[Charles I, Margrave of Baden-Baden|Charles of Baden-Baden]] and [[Ulrich V, Count of W?rttemberg|Ulrich V of W?rttemberg]] captive, and the Battle of [[Giengen an der Brenz|Geingen]], which was won by Louis.

== Result ==
A compromise was reached: Albert Achilles dropped his claims of imperial jurisdiction and Louis returned the territories he had occupied.  Further negotiations in Prague led to a peace treaty.

The alliances and results of this war are intertwined with other conflicts fought simultaneously in other parts of Germany, such as the [[Mainzer feud]].

== Situation in the Sechs?mterland in 1462 ==
An army from [[Bohemia]] and [[Cheb]] invaded the [[Sechs?mterland]] in 1462 and caused significant damage by looting and pillaging.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Dietel: ''Hallerstein, Landkreis M?nchberg, Schlo?, Herrschaft, Kirche und Dorf'', in: ''Archiv f?r die Geschichte von Oberfranken''&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Amtmann]] Frederick of Dobeneck at [[Thierstein Castle]] set fire to the village of [[Thierstein, Bavaria|Thierstein]] to prevent the enemy troops from entrenching in it.  Because he had allowed the villagers of Theirstein to seek refuge in the castle, he was unable to resiste a lengthy siege and had to surrender.  The Bohemians went on the capture [[Hohenberg Castle]] and burned down the city of [[Wei?enstadt]].

According to legend, [[Frederick of Sparneck]] vowed that he would found a monastery if he would be spared the ravages of war.  As he was spared, he founded [[Sparneck Abbey]].

At the [[Katharinenberg bei Wunsiedel]], Jobst of Schirnding managed to drive the Bohemians back, after a six-week unsuccessful siege of the city.  The church on the Katharinenberg was destroyed during the siege and has been a ruin ever since.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Hans Vollet und Kathrin Heckel: ''Die Ruinenzeichnungen des Plassenburgkartographen Johann Christoph Stierlein'', 1987&lt;/ref&gt;  His success was, however, not the result of military strength &amp;mdash; the invading armies were far stronger &amp;mdash; but due to internal conflicts between the Bohemians and the troops from Eger.  Several villages in the Eger area were destroyed by the retreating Bohemian army.&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth J?ger: ''Wunsiedel 1163?1560'', Wunsiedel, 1987, p. 242&lt;/ref&gt;  Local sources distinguish between a &quot;longer&quot; and a &quot;closer&quot; Hussite raid, thus linking the event to the [[Hussite Wars]].

War should be understood as an actual, intentional and widespread armed conflict between political communities, and therefore is defined as a form of [[political violence]].&lt;ref name=AHD /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/war/ |title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The set of techniques used by a group to carry out war is known as '''warfare'''. An absence of war, (and other violence) is usually called [[peace]].

In 2003, Nobel Laureate [[Richard E. Smalley]] identified war as the sixth (of ten) biggest problems facing the society of mankind for the next fifty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Smalley Institute Grand Challenges |first=Richard E. |last=Smalley |publisher=[[Rice University]] |year=2008 |accessdate=24 April 2011 |url=http://cnst.rice.edu/content.aspx?id=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1832 [[treatise]] ''[[On War]]'', Prussian military general and theoretician [[Carl von Clausewitz|Carl Von Clausewitz]] defined war as follows: &quot;War is thus an act of force to compel our enemy to do our will.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Clausewitz|first1= Carl von|authorlink1= Carl Von Clausewitz|editor1-first= Michael|editor1-last= Howard|editor1-link=Peter Paret|editor2-first= Peter|editor2-last= Paret |title= On War|trans_title= Vom Krieg |edition= Indexed |year= 1984 |origyear= 1832|publisher= Princeton University Press|location= New Jersey |isbn= 978-0-691-01854-6|page= 75}} Italics in original.&lt;/ref&gt;

While some scholars see warfare as an inescapable and integral aspect of human culture, others argue that it is only inevitable under certain socio-cultural or ecological circumstances. Some scholars argue that the practice of war is not linked to any single type of political organization or society. Rather, as discussed by [[John Keegan]] in his ''History of Warfare'', war is a universal phenomenon whose form and scope is defined by the society that wages it.&lt;ref&gt;Keegan, John, (1994) ''A History of Warfare'', (Pimlico)&lt;/ref&gt; Another argument suggests that since there are human societies in which warfare does not exist, humans may not be naturally disposed for warfare, which emerges under particular circumstance.&lt;ref&gt;Societies at Peace (Howell and Willis 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; The ever changing technologies and potentials of war extend along a historical continuum. At the one end lies the [[endemic warfare]] of the [[Paleolithic]] {{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} with its stones and clubs, and the naturally limited loss of life associated with the use of such weapons. Found at the other end of this continuum is [[nuclear warfare]], along with the recently developed possible outcome of its use, namely the potential risk of the complete [[human extinction|extinction of the human species]].

==Etymology==
[[File:Gari-Melchers-War-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|right|350px|Mural of War (1896), by [[Gari Melchers]].]]
The English word ''war'' derives from the late [[Old English]] (c.1050) words ''wyrre'' and ''werre''; the [[Old French|Old North French]] ''werre''; the [[Franks|Frankish]] ''werra''; and the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] ''werso''. The denotation of ''war'' derives from the [[Old Saxon]] ''werran'', [[Old High German]] ''werran'', and the German ''verwirren'': ?to confuse?, ?to perplex?, and ?to bring into confusion?.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=war |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=war |year=2010 |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another posited derivation is from the [[Ancient Greek]] ''barbaros'', the [[Old Persian]] ''varhara'', and the Sanskrit ''varvar'' and ''barbara''. In [[German language|German]], the equivalent is ''Krieg''; the equivalent [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[Italian language|Italian]] words for &quot;war&quot; is ''guerra'', derived from the Germanic ''werra'' (?fight?, ?tumult?).&lt;ref&gt;''Diccionario de la Lengua Espa?ola'', 21&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; edici?n (1992) p. 1071&lt;/ref&gt; Etymologic legend has it that the Romanic peoples adopted a foreign, Germanic word for &quot;war&quot;, to avoid using the [[Latin]] ''bellum'', because, when sounded, it tended to merge with the sound of the word ''bello'' (&quot;beautiful&quot;)

==History of warfare==
{{Main|History of war}}
Before the dawn of civilization, war likely consisted of small-scale raiding. One half of the people found in a [[Nubia]]n cemetery dating to as early as 12,000 years ago had died of violence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keeley&quot;&gt;Keeley: ''War before civilization: The myth of the peaceful savage''&lt;/ref&gt; Since the rise of the [[State (polity)|state]] some 5,000 years ago,&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared, Guns, Germs and Steel&lt;/ref&gt; military activity has occurred over much of the globe. The advent of [[gunpowder]] and the acceleration of technological advances led to modern warfare. According to Conway W. Henderson, &quot;One source claims 14,500 wars have taken place between 3500 BC and the late 20th century, costing 3.5 billion lives, leaving only 300 years of peace (Beer 1981: 20).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Conway W. Henderson (2010). ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=AwMovLqKw2oC&amp;pg=&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Understanding International Law]''. John Wiley and Sons. 212. ISBN 1-4051-9764-1&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[War Before Civilization]]'', Lawrence H. Keeley, a professor at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]], says that approximately 90?95% of known societies throughout history engaged in at least occasional warfare,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brneurosci.org/reviews/war.html |title=Review: War Before Civilization |publisher=Brneurosci.org |date=2006-09-04 |accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many fought constantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Front_Page/HG04Aa02.html|title=The fraud of primitive authenticity|last=Spengler|date=4 July 2006|work=Asia Times Online|accessdate=2009-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:War deaths caused by warfare.svg|thumb|right|300px|The percentages of men killed in war in eight tribal societies, and Europe and the U.S. in the 20th century. (Lawrence H. Keeley, Archeologist)]]
Keeley explained several styles of primitive combat such as, small raids, large raids, and massacres. All of these forms of warfare were perpetrated by primitive societies. The use of the massacre by pre-state societies can be exhibited by the [[Dogrib people|Dogrib]] tribes of the subartic in North America. The Dogrib tribe eventually destroyed the Yellowknife tribe by killing 4 men, 13 women, and 17 children which accounted for 20 percent of the population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keeley&quot;/&gt; This was a devastating blow from which the Yellowknife tribe never recovered.
Keeley further explains how small raids are not organized due to the lack of leadership and any formal training. This causes raids to be short and quick with relatively low numerical casualties but may significantly damage a percentage of a population. The deficit of resources also can account for a lack of fortifications and defensive structures in primitive prestate societies. The protection provided by a defensive could not justify the valuable resources used and labor implemented to build it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keeley&quot;/&gt;

[[William Rubinstein]] wrote that &quot;Pre-literate societies, even those organised in a relatively advanced way, were renowned for their studied cruelty ... 'archaeology yields evidence of prehistoric massacres more severe than any recounted in ethnography [ie, after the coming of the Europeans]'. At [[Crow Creek massacre|Crow Creek]], South Dakota, as noted, archaeologists found a [[mass grave]] of 'more than 500 men, women, and children who had been slaughtered, scalped, and mutilated during an attack on their village a century and a half before Columbus's arrival (ca. AD 1325)' &quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Rubinstein, W. D. (2004). ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=nMMAk4VwLLwC&amp;pg&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Genocide: a history]''. Pearson Education. pp.22?50. ISBN 0-582-50601-8&lt;/ref&gt;

In Western Europe, since the late 18th century, more than 150 conflicts and about 600 battles have taken place.&lt;ref name=War&gt;[http://www.ralphmag.org/CG/world-war-one2.html World War One ? A New Kind of War | Part II], From ''14 ? 18 Understanding the Great War'', by St?phane Audoin-Rouzeau, Annette Becker&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:MokoShuraiE-Kotoba IV.jpg|thumb|250px|Japanese [[samurai]] attacking a [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] ship, 13th century]]
The [[Human Security Report 2005]] documented a significant decline in the number and severity of armed conflicts since the end of the [[Cold War]] in the early 1990s. However, the evidence examined in the 2008 edition of the Center for International Development and Conflict Management's &quot;Peace and Conflict&quot; study indicated that the overall decline in conflicts had stalled.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, Joseph, J. Wilkenfield and T. nevertheless the concept war is more than just a word but a signification to the meaning Death. Gurr ''[http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/pc/ Peace and Conflict 2008]'', Paradigm Publishers, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent rapid increases in the technologies of war, and therefore in its destructiveness (see [[Mutual assured destruction]]), have caused widespread public concern, and have in all probability forestalled, and may hopefully altogether prevent the outbreak of a nuclear World War III. At the end of each of the last two World Wars, concerted and popular efforts were made to come to a greater understanding of the underlying dynamics of war and to thereby hopefully reduce or even eliminate it all together. These efforts materialized in the forms of the [[League of Nations]], and its successor, the [[United Nations]].

Shortly after [[World War II]], as a token of support for this concept, most nations joined the United Nations.
During this same post-war period, with the aim of further delegitimizing war as an acceptable and logical extension of foreign policy{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}, most national governments also renamed their Ministries or Departments of War as their Ministries or Departments of Defense, for example, the former US Department of War was renamed as the [[US Department of Defense]] .

In 1947, in view of the rapidly increasingly destructive consequences of modern warfare, and with a particular concern for the consequences and costs of the newly developed [[atom bomb]], the initial developer of the concept of this bomb, [[Albert Einstein]] famously stated, &quot;I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;EinsteinWWIV&quot;&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
Fortunately, the anticipated costs of a possible third world war are currently no longer deemed as acceptable by most, thus little motivation currently seems to exist on an international level for such a war.

Still since the close of World War II, limited non-nuclear conflicts continue, and surprisingly enough, some outspoken celebrities and politicians have even advocated for the proclamation of another world war.&lt;ref name = &quot;NewsCommentators&quot;&gt;{{cite web

==Types of warfare==
{{Original research|section|date=January 2010}}
War, to become known as one, must entail some degree of confrontation using weapons and other [[military technology and equipment]] by [[armed forces]] employing [[military tactics]] and [[operational art]] within the broad [[military strategy]] subject to [[military logistics]]. [[War Studies]] by military theorists throughout [[military history]] have sought to identify the [[philosophy of war]], and to reduce it to a [[military science]].
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H25224, Guernica, Ruinen.jpg|thumb|Ruins of [[Guernica]] (1937). The [[Spanish civil war]] was one of Europe's bloodiest and most brutal civil wars.]]
In general, modern military science considers several factors before a [[Defence policy|National defence policy]] is created to allow a war to commence: the environment in the area(s) of combat operations, the posture national forces will adopt on the commencement of a war, and the type of warfare troops will be engaged in.

[[Conventional warfare]] is an attempt to reduce an opponent's military capability through open battle. It is a declared war between existing states in which nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons are not used or only see limited deployment in support of conventional military goals and maneuvers.

The opposite of conventional warfare, [[unconventional warfare]], is an attempt to achieve military victory through acquiescence, capitulation, or clandestine support for one side of an existing conflict.

[[Nuclear warfare]] is warfare in which [[nuclear weapon]]s are the primary, or a major, method of coercing the capitulation of the other side, as opposed to a supporting tactical or strategic role in a conventional conflict.

[[Civil war]] is a war where the forces in conflict belong to the same nation or political entity and are vying for control of or independence from that nation or political entity.

[[Asymmetric warfare]] is a conflict between two populations of drastically different levels of military capability or size. Asymmetric conflicts often result in [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] tactics being used to overcome the sometimes vast gaps in technology and force size.

Intentional air pollution in combat is one of a collection of techniques collectively called [[chemical warfare]]. Poison gas as a [[Chemical warfare|chemical weapon]] was principally used during [[World War I]], and resulted in an estimated 91,198 deaths and 1,205,655 injuries.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Various treaties have sought to ban its further use. Non-lethal chemical weapons, such as [[tear gas]] and [[pepper spray]], are widely used, sometimes with deadly effect.

===Warfare environment===
The environment in which a war is fought has a significant impact on the type of combat which takes place, and can include within its area different types of terrain. This, in turn, means that soldiers have to be trained to fight in a specific types of environments and terrains that generally reflects troops' mobility limitations or enablers.
These include:

===Behaviour and conduct in war===
{{rquote|right|The nature of warfare ''never'' changes, only its superficial manifestations. [[Joshua]] and [[David]], [[Hector]] and [[Achilles]] would recognize the combat that our soldiers and Marines have waged in the alleys of Somalia and Iraq. The uniforms evolve, bronze gives way to titanium, arrows may be replaced by laser-guided bombs, but the heart of the matter is still killing your enemies until any survivors surrender and do your will.|[[Ralph Peters]]&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Ralph. ''New Glory: Expanding America's Global Supremacy'', 2005. p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The behaviour of troops in warfare varies considerably, both individually and as units or armies. In some circumstances, troops may engage in [[genocide]], [[war rape]] and [[ethnic cleansing]]. Commonly, however, the conduct of troops may be limited to posturing and sham attacks, leading to highly rule-bound and often largely symbolic combat in which casualties are much reduced from that which would be expected if soldiers were genuinely violent towards the enemy.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1996&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Lt. Col. Dave Grossman|title=On Killing ? The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War &amp; Society|publisher= Little, Brown &amp; Co., |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Situations of deliberate dampening of hostilities occurred in [[World War I]] by some accounts, e.g., a volley of gunfire being exchanged after a misplaced mortar hit the British line, after which a German soldier shouted an apology to British forces, effectively stopping a hostile exchange of gunfire.&lt;ref&gt;Axelrod, Robert. 1984. ''The Evolution of Cooperation.'' New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of non-aggression, also from [[World War I]], are detailed in &quot;[[Good-Bye to All That]].&quot; These include spontaneous ceasefires to rebuild defences and retrieve casualties, alongside behaviour such as refusing to shoot at enemy during ablutions and the taking of great risks (described as 1 in 20) to retrieve enemy wounded from the battlefield. The most notable spontaneous ceasefire of [[World War I]] was the [[Christmas truce]].

The psychological separation between combatants, and the destructive power of modern weaponry, may act to override this effect and facilitate participation by combatants in the mass slaughter of combatants or civilians, such as in the bombing of [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|Dresden in World War II]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The unusual circumstances of warfare can incite apparently normal individuals to commit atrocities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waller|first=James|title=Becoming Evil: How Ordinary People Commit Genocide and Mass Killing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On soldiers===
Soldiers subject to combat in war often suffer psychological and physical casualties, including depression, [[Post Traumatic Stress Disorder]], disease, injury, and death.

{{Quote|In every war in which American soldiers have fought in, the chances of becoming a psychiatric casualty ? of being debilitated for some period of time as a consequence of the stresses of military life ? were greater than the chances of being killed by enemy fire.|''No More Heroes'', Richard Gabriel&lt;ref name=War/&gt;}}

During World War II, research conducted by US Army Brigadier General S.L.A. Marshall found that, on average, only 15% to 20% of American riflemen in WWII combat fired at the enemy.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1996&quot;/&gt; In Civil War Collector?s Encyclopedia, F.A. Lord notes that of the 27,574 discarded muskets found on the Gettysburg battlefield, nearly 90% were loaded, with 12,000 loaded more than once and 6,000 loaded 3 to 10 times. These studies suggest that most soldiers resist firing their weapons in combat, that- as some theorists argue- human beings have an inherent resistance to killing their fellow human beings.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1996&quot;/&gt; Swank and Marchand?s WWII study found that after sixty days of continuous combat, 98% of all surviving soldiers will become psychiatric casualties. Psychiatric casualties manifest themselves in fatigue cases, confusional states, conversion hysteria, anxiety, obsessional and compulsive states, and character disorders.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1996&quot;/&gt;

{{Quote|One-tenth of mobilised American men were hospitalised for mental disturbances between 1942 and 1945, and after thirty-five days of uninterrupted combat, 98% of them manifested psychiatric disturbances in varying degrees.|''14?18: Understanding the Great War'', St?phane Audoin-Rouzeau, Annette Becker&lt;ref name=War/&gt;}}

Additionally, it has been estimated that anywhere from 18% to 54% of Vietnam war veterans suffered from [[Post Traumatic Stress Disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1996&quot;/&gt;

Based on 1860 census figures, 8% of all white American males aged 13 to 43 died in the [[American Civil War]], including about 6% in the North and approximately 18% in the South.&lt;ref&gt;Maris Vinovskis (1990).

Cambridge University Press. p.7. ISBN 0-521-39559-3&lt;/ref&gt; The war remains the deadliest conflict in American history, resulting in the deaths of 620,000 soldiers.

===On civilians===
{{see also|Civilian casualties}}

Many wars have been accompanied by significant depopulations, along with destruction of infrastructure and resources (which may lead to [[famine]], disease, and death in the civilian population). Civilians in war zones may also be subject to war atrocities such as [[genocide]], while survivors may suffer the psychological aftereffects of witnessing the destruction of war. During the [[Thirty Years' War]] in Europe, for example, the population of the [[Holy Roman Empire|German]] states was reduced by about 30%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/warstat0.htm#30YrW The Thirty Years War (1618?48)], Alan McFarlane, The Savage Wars of Peace: England, Japan and the Malthusian Trap (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/195896/history-of-Europe/58335/Demographics#ref=ref310375 History of Europe ?

Estimates for the total [[World War II casualties|casualties of World War II]] vary, but most suggest that some 60 million people died in the war, comprising around 20 million soldiers and 40 million civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World War II Fatalities|url=http://www.secondworldwar.co.uk/casualty.html|accessdate=2007-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Soviet Union]] lost around [[World War II casualties of the Soviet Union|27 million people]] during the war, about half of all World War II casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4530565.stm|title=Leaders mourn Soviet wartime dead | date=May 9, 2005 | accessdate=January 6, 2010|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since a high proportion of those killed were young men, the postwar Soviet population was 45 to 50 million fewer than post?1939 projections would have led one to expect.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey A. Hosking (2006). ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=CDMVMqDvp4QC&amp;pg=PA242&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Rulers and victims: the Russians in the Soviet Union]''. [[Harvard University Press]]. p.242. ISBN 0-674-02178-9&lt;/ref&gt; The largest number of civilian deaths in a single city was 1.2 million citizens dead during the 872-day [[Siege of Leningrad]].

===On the economy===
{{see also|Military keynesianism}}

Once a war has ended, losing nations are sometimes required to pay [[war reparations]] to the victorious nations. In certain cases, land is ceded to the victorious nations. For example, the territory of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] has been traded between France and Germany on three different occasions.

Typically speaking, war becomes very intertwined with the economy and many wars are partially or entirely based on economic reasons such as the [[American Civil War]]. In some cases war has stimulated a country's economy (World War II is often credited with bringing America out of the [[Great Depression]]) but in many cases, such as the wars of Louis XIV, the [[Franco-Prussian War]], and [[World War I]], warfare serves only to damage the economy of the countries involved. For example, Russia's involvement in World War I took such a toll on the Russian economy that it almost collapsed and greatly contributed to the start of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]].

====World War II====
One of the starkest illustrations of the effect of war upon economies is the [[Second World War]]. The [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s ended as nations increased their production of war materials to serve the [[war effort]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/learn/features/timeline/depwwii/depwar.html Great Depression and World War II]. ''The Library of Congress''.&lt;/ref&gt; The financial cost of World War II is estimated at about a trillion U.S. dollars worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, E. (2000) [http://emayzine.com/lectures/WWII.html &quot;World War II&quot;] course lecture notes on ''Emayzine.com'' (Victorville, California: Victor Valley College)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, P. (1999) [http://replay.web.archive.org/20080302153205/http://members.aol.com/forcountry/ww2/wc1.htm &quot;Cost of the War,&quot;] ''World War II Resource Guide'' (Gardena, California: The American War Library)&lt;/ref&gt; making it the most costly war in capital as well as lives.

By the end of the war, the European economy had collapsed with 70% of the industrial infrastructure destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Pilisuk, Jennifer Achord Rountree (2008). ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=r9kNZrmG0E8C&amp;pg=PA136&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Who benefits from global violence and war: uncovering a destructive system]''. [[Greenwood Publishing Group]]. p.136. ISBN 0-275-99435-X&lt;/ref&gt; Property damage in the Soviet Union inflicted by the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Axis invasion]] was estimated to a value of 679 billion rubles. The combined damage consisted of complete or partial destruction of 1,710 cities and towns, 70,000 villages/hamlets, 2,508 church buildings, 31,850 industrial establishments, 40,000 miles of railroad, 4100 railroad stations, 40,000 hospitals, 84,000 schools, and 43,000 public libraries.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New York Times]]'', 9 February 1946, Volume 95, Number 32158.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors ending a war==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2008}}

{{Original research|section|date=January 2010}}
[[File:Aftermath Battle of Triboltingen.jpg|thumb|Women and priests retrieve the dead bodies of Swabian soldiers just outside the city gates of Constance after the [[battle of Schwaderloh]]. ''([[Luzerner Schilling]])'']]
The political and economic circumstances, in the peace that follows war, usually depend on the [[facts on the ground]]. Where evenly matched adversaries decide that the conflict has resulted in a [[stalemate]], they may cease hostilities to avoid further loss of life and property. They may decide to restore the [[antebellum period|antebellum]] territorial boundaries, redraw boundaries at the line of military control, or negotiate to keep or exchange captured territory. Negotiations between parties involved at the end of a war often result in a [[treaty]], such as the [[Treaty of Versailles]] of 1919, which ended the [[World War I|First World War]].

A warring party that [[surrender (military)|surrenders]] or [[capitulation (surrender)|capitulates]] may have little negotiating power, with the victorious side either imposing a settlement or dictating most of the terms of any treaty. A common result is that conquered territory is brought under the dominion of the stronger military power. An [[unconditional surrender]] is made in the face of overwhelming military force as an attempt to prevent further harm to life and property. For example, the [[Empire of Japan]] gave an unconditional surrender to the [[Allies of World War II]] after the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] (see [[Surrender of Japan]]), the preceding massive strategic bombardment of Japan and declaration of war and the immediate invasion of Manchuria by the Soviet Union. A settlement or surrender may also be obtained through [[deception]] or bluffing.

Many other wars, however, have ended in complete destruction of the opposing territory, such as the [[Battle of Carthage (c. 149 BCE)|Battle of Carthage]] of the [[Third Punic War]] between the [[Phoenicia]]n city of [[Carthage]] and Ancient Rome in 149 BC. In 146 BC the Romans burned the city, enslaved its citizens, and razed the buildings.

Some wars or aggressive actions end when the military objective of the victorious side has been achieved. Others do not, especially in cases where the state structures do not exist, or have collapsed prior to the victory of the conqueror. In such cases, disorganised [[Guerrilla warfare|guerilla warfare]] may continue for a considerable period. In cases of complete surrender conquered territories may be brought under the permanent dominion of the victorious side. A raid for the purposes of [[looting]] may be completed with the successful capture of goods. In other cases an aggressor may decide to end hostilities to avoid continued losses and cease hostilities without obtaining the original objective, such as happened in the [[Iran?Iraq War]].

Some hostilities, such as [[insurgency]] or [[civil war]], may persist for long periods of time with only a low level of military activity. In some cases there is no negotiation of any official treaty, but fighting may trail off and eventually stop after the political demands of the belligerent groups have been reconciled, a political settlement has been negotiated, the combatants are gradually killed or decide the conflict is futile, or the belligerents cease active military engagement but still threatens each other. An example is the [[Chinese Civil War]] which essentially ceased by 1950 but the [[People's Republic of China]] fought diplomatically to isolate Taiwan, but it still threatens [[Republic of China]] (commonly known as [[Taiwan]]) with an invasion. For this reason, some historians consider the war not ended but continuing.

==Efforts to stop wars==
[[File:1917 - Execution ? Verdun lors des mutineries.jpg|thumb|Execution at Verdun at the time of the [[French Army Mutinies (1917)|mutinies]] of 1917, when parts of the French Army refused to conduct further offensive operations.]]
Anti-war movements have existed for every major war in the 20th century, including, most prominently, [[World War I]], [[World War II]], and the [[Vietnam War]]. In the 21st century, worldwide anti-war movements occurred ever since the United States declared wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. In 2001, the US government decided to invade Afghanistan to fight against international terrorism that caused the [[September 11 attacks]]. [[Opposition to the War in Afghanistan (2001?present)|Opposition to the War in Afghanistan]] spread all over the world. Protests occurred in cities in Europe, Asia, and all over the United States, criticizing its ineffectiveness and illegitimacy. However, they did not stop the US engagement in the war. As of now, the public view worldwide does not seem to favor the war. Organizations like [[Stop the War Coalition]], based in the United Kingdom, keep working on campaigning against the War. They raise awareness of the war, organize demonstrations, and lobby the governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ur|=http://stopwar.org.uk/index.php/about/timeline-of-stop-the-war-events-2001-2011 |title=Stop the War Coalition: Timeline of Events 2001?2011 |accessdate=2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There also exist significant worldwide [[opposition to the Iraq War]]. The US engaged in the war to eliminate the weapons of mass destruction that the Iraqi government allegedly had developed. Critics oppose the war based on the argument of violation of sovereignty, civilian deaths, absence of the UN approval, and lack of justification. However, they did not stop the involvement again. Since then, the US government has been harshly criticized by the public, domestically and internationally, for its conduct during the war, especially in the killings of civilians. Even though the government has been counting the US soldiers up until now, they have refused to release numbers on the civilian deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ur|=http://www.iraqbodycount.org/ |title=Iraq Body Count |accessdate=2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual projects like [[Iraq Body Count project]] tries to reveal the actual number of deaths from the war based on journalistic data, showing the civilian effort to face the truth of war.

The [[Mexican Drug War]], with estimated casualties of 40,000 since December 2006, has been recently facing a fundamental opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ur|=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/laplaza/2011/06/mexico-war-dead-update-figures-40000.html |title=How many have died in Mexico's drug war? |accessdate=2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the movement for peace and justice has started a popular middle-class movement against the war. It has won the recognition of President Calderon, who started the war, but has not ended it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ur|=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/americas/2011/06/20116244495608277.html |title=Calderon apologises to drug war victims |accessdate=2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governments also use the method of [[disarmament]] to stop and prevent the cost of war.

==Motivations==
Motivations for war may be different for those ordering the war than for those undertaking the war. For example, in the [[Third Punic War]], Rome's leaders may have wished to make war with [[Carthage]] for the purpose of eliminating a resurgent rival, while the individual soldiers may have been motivated by a wish to make money. Since many people are involved, a war may acquire a life of its own from the confluence of many different motivations.

The Jewish [[Talmud]] describes in the BeReshit Rabbah commentary on the fight between [[Cain and Abel]] (Parashot BeReshit XXII:7) that there are three universal reasons for wars: A) Economic, B) Ideological/religious, and C) Power/pride/love (personal).&lt;ref name = &quot;MidrashQuote&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The Tatars essentially sought booty, especially [[Slavery in the Ottoman Empire|slaves]].]]
In ''Why Nations Go to War'', by [[John G. Stoessinger]], the author points out that both sides will claim that morality justifies their fight. He also states that the rationale for beginning a war depends on an overly optimistic assessment of the outcome of hostilities (casualties and costs), and on [[Fundamental attribution error|misperceptions of the enemy's intentions]].

As the strategic and tactical aspects of warfare are always changing, theories and doctrines relating to warfare are often reformulated before, during, and after every major war. [[Carl Von Clausewitz]] said, 'Every age had its own kind of war, its own limiting conditions, and its own peculiar preconceptions.' &lt;ref&gt;Clausewitz, Carl Von (1976), On War (Princeton University Press) p.593&lt;/ref&gt; The one constant factor is war?s employment of organized violence and the resultant destruction of property and/ or lives that necessarily follows.

===Psychoanalytic psychology===
Dutch psychoanalyst [[Joost Meerloo]] held that, &quot;War is often...a mass discharge of accumulated internal rage (where)...the inner fears of mankind are discharged in mass destruction.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;meerloo&quot;&gt;
| A. M. Meerloo, M.D. ''The Rape of the Mind'' (2009) p.134, Progressive Press, ISBN 978-1-61577-376-3
&lt;/ref&gt; Thus war can sometimes be a means by which man's own frustration at his inability to master his own self is expressed and temporarily relieved via his unleashing of destructive behavior upon ''others.'' In this destructive scenario, these ''others'' are made to serve as the scapegoat of man's own unspoken and subconscious frustrations and fears.

Other psychoanalysts such as E.F.M. Durban and [[John Bowlby]] have argued that human beings are [[Inheritance|inherently]] violent.&lt;ref&gt;Durbin, E.F.L. and John Bowlby. ''Personal Aggressiveness and War'' 1939.&lt;/ref&gt; This aggressiveness is fueled by [[displacement (psychology)|displacement]] and [[Psychological projection|projection]] where a person transfers his or her grievances into bias and hatred against other [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]], religions, nations or [[Ideology|ideologies]]. By this theory, the nation state preserves order in the local society while creating an outlet for aggression through warfare. If war is innate to human nature, as is presupposed and predetermined by many psychological theories, then there is little hope of ever escaping it.

The Italian psychoanalyst Franco Fornari, a follower of [[Melanie Klein]], thought that war was the paranoid or projective ?elaboration? of mourning.&lt;ref&gt;(Fornari 1975)&lt;/ref&gt; Fornari thought that war and violence develop out of our ?love need?: our wish to preserve and defend the sacred object to which we are attached, namely our early mother and our fusion with her. For the adult, nations are the sacred objects that generate warfare. Fornari focused upon sacrifice as the essence of war: the astonishing willingness of human beings to die for their country, to give over their bodies to their nation.

Despite Fornari's theory that man's altruistic desire for self-sacrifice for a noble cause is a contributing factor towards war, in history only a tiny fraction of wars have originated from a desire for war from the general populace.&lt;ref&gt;Blanning, T.C.W. &quot;The Origin of Great Wars.&quot; ''The Origins of the French Revolutionary Wars.'' pg. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Far more often the general population has been reluctantly drawn into war by its rulers. One psychological theory that looks at the leaders is advanced by Maurice Walsh.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, Maurice N. ''War and the Human Race.'' 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the general populace is more neutral towards war and that wars only occur when leaders with a psychologically abnormal disregard for human life are placed into power. War is caused by leaders that seek war such as [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] and [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]. Such leaders most often come to power in times of crisis when the populace opts for a decisive leader, who then leads the nation to war.

{{quote|Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship. ... the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.

===Evolutionary theories===
{{POV-section|date=October 2011}}
{{Disputed-section|date=October 2011}}
Several theories concern the evolutionary origins of warfare. There are two main schools one sees organized warfare as emerging only in the mesolithic, as a result of the emergence of complex social organization, higher population density and political organization and competition over resources. The other school tends to see human warfare simply as an extension of animal behavior, such as territoriality and sexual [[competition]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Meyer. Social Evolution in Franz M. Wuketits and Christoph Antweiler (eds.) Handbook of Evolution The Evolution of Human Societies and Cultures Wiley-VCH Verlag&lt;/ref&gt;

This school argues that since organized warlike behavior patterns are also found in many other primate species such as [[chimpanzee]]s,&lt;ref name = &quot;ApesWar&quot;&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; this suggests that between group conflict is a general feature of animal social behavior. Biologists studying primate behavior have added to the debate, documenting warlike activities among several primate species and seeing similarities to humans.&lt;ref&gt;Crofoot, Margaret C. and Richard W. Wrangham, 2010 &quot;Intergroup Aggression in Primates and Humans: The Case for a Unified Theory&quot; in Kappeler, Thomas M &amp; Joan B Silk (eds) ''Mind the Gap ? tracing the origins of human universals''. Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that while war may be a natural phenomenon, the development of technology and complex social organization has accelerated the scale of warfare to exceptional levels among modern humans, starting at some point in the mesolithic, and escalating with the development of weaponry and large-scale state formations.&lt;ref&gt;Johan M.G. van der Dennen. 1995. The Origin of War: Evolution of a Male-Coalitional Reproductive Strategy. Origin Press, Groningen, 1995 chapters 1 &amp; 2&lt;/ref&gt;
[[image:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Een Ibu Dajak krijger uit Long Nawan Z. en O. afdeling Borneo. TMnr 60034031.jpg|thumb|[[Dayak people|Dayak]] headhunters in Borneo]]
One line of evidence for violent conflict among the ancestors of humans is [[sexual dimorphism]]. In species that have high levels of male competition over females, males tend to be larger and stronger than females. Humans have considerable sexual dimorphism, although lower than our nearest primate relatives.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Lewin and Robert Foley. 2004 Principles of human evolution, 2nd ed.p. 182-3&lt;/ref&gt; The strength difference is greater for upper-body strength than for lower-body strength. Men are in general terms also larger, faster, and more aggressive. Their skeleton, especially in the vulnerable face, is more robust. This suggests that male competition has been an important factor in human evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2010.02.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steven Pinker]] in his book ''[[The Blank Slate]]'' argues that raiding or warfare between groups of humans in the ancestral environment was often beneficial for the victors. This includes gaining control over scarce resources as well as the women of the defeated or raided group. Various features of modern warfare such as alliances between groups and [[preemptive war]]s were likely part of these conflicts. In order to have a credible [[deterrence theory|deterrence]] against other groups (as well as on an individual level), it was important to have a reputation for retaliation, causing humans to develop instincts for [[revenge]] as well as for protecting a group's (or an individual's) reputation (&quot;[[honor]]&quot;). Pinker argues that the development of the state and the police have dramatically reduced the level of warfare and violence compared to the ancestral environment. Whenever the state breaks down, which can be very locally such as in poor areas of a city, humans again organize in groups for protection and aggression and concepts such as violent revenge and protecting honor again become extremely important.

[[Ashley Montagu]] strongly denied universalistic instinctual arguments, arguing that social factors and childhood socialization are important in determining the nature and presence of warfare. Thus, he argues, while human aggression may be a universal occurrence, warfare is not, and would appear to have been a historical invention, associated with certain types of human societies.&lt;ref&gt;Montagu, Ashley (1976), ''The Nature of Human Aggression'' (Oxford University Press)&lt;/ref&gt; This argument has been supported by ethnographic research conducted in societies where the concept of aggression seems to be entirely absent, e.g., the [[Chewong_language|Chewong]] of the Malay peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Howell, Signe and Roy Willis, eds. (1989) Societies at Peace: Anthropological Perspectives. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; Crofoot and Wrangham have instead argued that warfare, if defined as group interactions in which &quot;coalitions attempt to aggressively dominate or kill members of other groups&quot;, is a characteristic of most human societies. Those in which it has been lacking &quot;tend to be societies that were politically dominated by their neighbors&quot;.&lt;ref name=HumanPrimateAggression&gt;&quot;Mind the Gap: Tracing the Origins of Human Universals&quot; By Peter M. Kappeler, Joan B. Silk, 2009, Chapter 8, &quot;Intergroup Aggression in Primates and Humans; The Case for a Unified Theory&quot;, Margaret C. Crofoot and Richard W. Wrangham&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic theories===
[[File:Disabled Iraqi T-54A, T-55, Type 59 or Type 69 tank and burning Kuwaiti oil field.jpg|thumb|Kuwaiti [[oil well]]s on fire, during the [[Gulf War]], 1 March 1991]]
War can be seen as a growth of [[Economy|economic]] competition in a competitive international system. In this view wars begin as a pursuit of markets for [[natural resource]]s and for wealth. While this theory has been applied to many conflicts, such counter arguments become less valid as the increasing mobility of capital and information level the distributions of wealth worldwide, or when considering that it is relative, not absolute, wealth differences that may fuel wars. There are those on the extreme [[right (politics)|right]] of the political spectrum who provide support, [[Fascism|fascists]] in particular, by asserting a natural right of a strong nation to whatever the weak cannot hold by force.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Griffin]] and Matthew Feldman, eds., ''[[Fascism]]: Fascism and Culture'', New York: [[Routledge]], 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins, Mike. ''[[Social Darwinism]] in European and American Thought, 1860?1945: Nature as Model and Nature as Threat'', [[Cambridge University Press]], 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Some centrist, [[capitalism|capitalist]], world leaders, including [[Presidents of the United States]] and US [[General officer|Generals]], expressed support for an economic view of war.

===Marxist theories===
The [[Marxism|Marxist]] theory of war is quasi-economic in that it states that all modern wars are caused by competition for resources and markets between great ([[Imperialism|imperialist]]) powers, claiming these wars are a natural result of the [[free market]] and [[Social class|class system]]. Part of the theory is that war will only disappear once a [[world revolution]], over-throwing free markets and class systems, has occurred. German Marxist [[Rosa Luxembourg]] theorized that [[imperialism]] was the result of capitalist countries needing new [[economic market|markets]]. Expansion of the [[means of production]] is only possible if there is a corresponding growth in [[consumer demand]]. Since the workers in a [[capitalist economy]] would be unable to fill the demand, producers must expand into non-capitalist markets to find consumers for their goods, hence driving imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/mandel/1955/08/imp-crit.html |title=The Marxist Theory of Imperialism and its Critics |first=Einde |last=O'Callaghan |publisher=[[Marxist Internet Archive]] |date=25 October 2007 |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demographic theories===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[The Clash of Civilizations|Clash of Civilizations]] --&gt;

Demographic theories can be grouped into two classes, Malthusian theories and [[youth bulge]] theories.

====Malthusian theories====
[[File:US soldiers in Kismayo, 1993.JPEG|thumb|US Army soldiers in [[Somalia]], 1993]]
Malthusian theories see expanding population and scarce resources as a source of violent conflict.

[[Pope Urban II]] in 1095, on the eve of the [[First Crusade]], spoke:
{{quote|For this land which you now inhabit, shut in on all sides by the sea and the mountain peaks, is too narrow for your large population; it scarcely furnishes food enough for its cultivators. Hence it is that you murder and devour one another, that you wage wars, and that many among you perish in civil strife. Let hatred, therefore, depart from among you; let your quarrels end. Enter upon the road to the Holy Sepulchre; wrest that land from a wicked race, and subject it to yourselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Lend me your ears: great speeches in history |first=William |last=Safire |publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] |year=200] |isbn=978-0-393-05931-1 |page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This is one of the earliest expressions of what has come to be called the Malthusian theory of war, in which wars are caused by expanding populations and limited resources. [[Thomas Malthus]] (1766?1834) wrote that populations always increase until they are limited by war, [[disease]], or [[famine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Geography: an integrated approach |first=David |last=Waugh |publisher=[[Nelson Thornes]] |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-17-444706-1 |page=378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This theory is thought by Malthusians to account for the relative decrease in wars during the past fifty years, especially in the [[Developed country|developed world]], where advances in agriculture have made it possible to support a much larger population than was formerly the case, and where [[birth control]] has dramatically slowed the increase in population.

====Youth bulge theory====
[[File:Median age.png|thumb|300px|[[Population pyramid|Median age]] by country. A youth bulge is evident for [[Demographics of Africa|Africa]], and to a lesser extent for South and Southeast Asia and Central America.]]
[[Youth bulge]] theory differs significantly from Malthusian theories. Its adherents see a combination of large male youth cohorts ? as graphically represented as a &quot;youth bulge&quot; in a [[population pyramid]] ? with a lack of regular, peaceful [[employment]] opportunities as a risk pool for violence.

While Malthusian theories focus on a disparity between a growing population and available natural resources, youth bulge theory focuses on a disparity between non-inheriting, 'excess' young males and available social positions within the existing social system of [[division of labour]].

Contributors to the development of [[youth bulge]] theory include French sociologist Gaston Bouthoul,&lt;ref&gt;Bouthoul, Gaston: &quot;L`infanticide diff?r?&quot; (deferred infanticide), Paris 1970&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. sociologist [[Jack Goldstone|Jack A.

Huntington|Samuel Huntington]] has modified his [[The Clash of Civilizations|Clash of Civilizations]] theory by using youth bulge theory as its foundation:

{{quote|I don't think Islam is any more violent than any other religions, and I suspect if you added it all up, more people have been slaughtered by Christians over the centuries than by Muslims. But the key factor is the demographic factor. Generally speaking, the people who go out and kill other people are males between the ages of 16 and 30.

During the 1960s, 70s and 80s there were high birth rates in the Muslim world, and this has given rise to a huge youth bulge. But the bulge will fade. Muslim birth rates are going down; in fact, they have dropped dramatically in some countries. Islam did spread by the sword originally, but I don't think there is anything inherently violent in Muslim theology.&lt;ref&gt;?So, are civilizations at war??, Interview with Samuel P. Huntington by Michael Steinberger, The Observer, Sunday October 21, 2001 [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/islam/story/0,,577982,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Youth Bulge theories represent a relatively recent development but seem to have become more influential in guiding U.S. foreign policy and military strategy as both Goldstone and Fuller have acted as consultants to the U.S. Government. CIA Inspector General [[John L. Helgerson]] referred to youth bulge theory in his 2002 report &quot;The National Security Implications of Global Demographic Change&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Helgerson, John L. (2002): &quot;The National Security Implications of Global Demographic Trends&quot;[http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/cia/helgerson2.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Palestinian militant with rifle.png|thumb|Palestinian militant with rifle, 2009]]
According to Heinsohn, who has proposed youth bulge theory in its most generalized form, a youth bulge occurs when 30 to 40 percent of the males of a nation belong to the &quot;fighting age&quot; cohorts from 15 to 29 years of age. It will follow periods with [[total fertility rate]]s as high as 4-8 children per woman with a 15-29 year delay.

A total fertility rate of 2.1 children born by a woman during her lifetime represents a situation of in which the son will replace the father, and the daughter will replace the mother accounting for a small proportion of deaths to factors such as illness and accidents. Thus, a total fertility rate of 2.1 represents replacement level, while anything below represents a [[sub-replacement fertility]] rate leading to [[population decline]].

Total fertility rates above 2.1 will lead to population growth and to a youth bulge. A total fertility rate of 4-8 children per mother implies 2-4 sons per mother. Consequently, one father has to leave not 1, but 2 to 4 social positions (jobs) to give all his sons a perspective for life, which is usually hard to achieve. Since respectable positions cannot be increased at the same speed as food, textbooks and vaccines, many &quot;angry young men&quot; find themselves in a situation that tends to escalate their adolescent anger into violence: they are

# Demographically superfluous,
# Might be out of work or stuck in a menial job, and
# Often have no access to a legal sex life before a career can earn them enough to provide for a family. ''See: [[Hypergamy]], [[Waithood]]''.

The combination of these [[stress (biological)|stress]] factors according to Heinsohn&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/funnyguy_35/DefenceTraining.PDF&amp;date=2009-10-25+22:25:12 |title=Heinsohn, G.(2006): &quot;Demography and War.&quot; |publisher=Webcitation.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually heads for one of six different exits:
[[Image:Detenciones Michoac?n.jpg|thumb|right|Mexican soldiers detain [[Mexican Drug War|cartel]] suspects in Michoac?n, 2007]]
# [[Emigration]] (&quot;non violent [[colonization]]&quot;)
# Violent [[Crime]]
# Rebellion or [[putsch]]
# [[Civil war]] and/or [[revolution]]
# [[Genocide]] (to take over the positions of the slaughtered)
# [[Conquest (military)|Conquest]] (violent colonization, frequently including genocide abroad).

Religions and ideologies are seen as secondary factors that are being used to legitimate violence, but will not lead to violence by themselves if no youth bulge is present. Consequently, youth bulge theorists see both past &quot;Christianist&quot; European colonialism and imperialism and today's &quot;Islamist&quot; civil unrest and terrorism as results of high birth rates producing youth bulges.&lt;ref&gt;Heinsohn, G.(2005): &quot;Population, Conquest and Terror in the 21st Century.&quot; [http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/funnyguy_35/HeinsohnPopulation.PDF&amp;date=2009-10-25+22:25:15]&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Gaza Strip]] now being seen as another example of youth-bulge-driven violence, especially if compared to [[Lebanon]] which is geographically close, yet remarkably more peaceful.&lt;ref&gt;G.

Among prominent historical events that have been linked to the existence of youth bulges is the role played by the historically large youth cohorts in the rebellion and revolution waves of early modern Europe, including [[French Revolution]] of 1789,&lt;ref&gt;Goldstone, Jack A.: &quot;Revolution and Rebellion in the Early Modern World&quot;, Berkeley 1991 [http://books.google.de/books?id=M-T9dR7nWDUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=goldstone+revolution&amp;hl=de&amp;ei=gUQ2TYLlBpT34AaM5PTwAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; and the importance of economic depression hitting the largest German youth cohorts ever in explaining the rise of [[Nazism]] in Germany in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Moller, Herbert (1968): ?Youth as a Force in the Modern World?, Comparative Studies in Society and
History 10: 238?260; 240?244&lt;/ref&gt; The 1994 [[Rwandan Genocide]] has also been analyzed as following a massive youth bulge.&lt;ref&gt;Diessenbacher, Hartmut (1994): Kriege der Zukunft.

While the implications of population growth have been known since the completion of the [[National Security Study Memorandum 200]] in 1974,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.population-security.org/28-APP2.html |title=National Security Study Memorandum 200 (NSSM 200) ?

Prominent demographer [[Stephen D. Mumford]] attributes this to the influence of the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen D. Mumford: [http://www.population-security.org/index.html ''The Life and Death of NSSM 200: How the Destruction of Political Will Doomed a U.S. Population Policy'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Youth bulge theories have been criticized as leading to racial, gender and age &quot;discrimination&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hendrixson, Anne: &quot;Angry Young Men, Veiled Young Women: Constructing a New Population Threat&quot; [http://www.thecornerhouse.org.uk/item.shtml?x=85999]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rationalist theories===
Rationalist theories of war assume that both sides to a potential war are rational, which is to say that each side wants to get the best possible outcome for itself for the least possible loss of life and property to its own side. Given this assumption, if both countries knew in advance how the war would turn out, it would be better for both of them to just accept the post-war outcome without having to actually pay the costs of fighting the war. This is based on the notion, generally agreed to by almost all scholars of war since [[Carl von Clausewitz]], that wars are reciprocal, that all wars require both a decision to attack and also a decision to resist attack.
Rationalist theory offers three reasons why some countries cannot find a bargain and instead resort to war: issue indivisibility, [[information asymmetry]] with incentive to deceive, and the inability to make credible commitments.&lt;ref&gt;Fearon, James D. 1995. &quot;Rationalist Explanations for War.&quot; International Organization 49, 3: 379-414. [http://www.polisci.ucsd.edu/~bslantch/courses/pdf/fearon-io1995v49n3.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:U.S. Marines in Operation Allen Brook (Vietnam War) 001.jpg|thumb|U.S. Marines direct a concentration of fire at the enemy, Vietnam, 8 May 1968]]
Issue indivisibility occurs when the two parties cannot avoid war by bargaining because the thing over which they are fighting cannot be shared between them, only owned entirely by one side or the other. Religious issues, such as control over the [[Temple Mount]] in Jerusalem, are more likely to be indivisible than economic issues.

A bigger branch of the theory, advanced by scholars of international relations such as [[Geoffrey Blainey]], is that both sides decide to go to war and one side may have miscalculated.

Some go further and say that there is a problem of information asymmetry with incentives to misrepresent. The two countries may not agree on who would win a war between them, or whether victory would be overwhelming or merely eked out, because each side has military secrets about its own capabilities. They will not avoid the bargaining [[failure]] by sharing their secrets, since they cannot trust each other not to lie and exaggerate their strength to extract more concessions. For example, Sweden made efforts to deceive Nazi Germany that it would resist an attack fiercely, partly by playing on the myth of Aryan superiority and by making sure that [[Hermann G?ring]] only saw elite troops in action, often dressed up as regular soldiers, when he came to visit.

The American decision to enter the [[Vietnam War]] was made with the full knowledge that the communist forces would resist them, but did not believe that the guerrillas had the capability to long oppose [[United States armed forces|American forces]].

Thirdly, bargaining may fail due to the states' inability to make credible commitments.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, Robert. 2002. &quot;Bargaining Theory and International Conflict.&quot; ''Annual Review of Political Science'' 5: 1-30.&lt;/ref&gt; In this scenario, the two countries might be able to come to a bargain that would avert war if they could stick to it, but the benefits of the bargain will make one side more powerful and lead it to demand even more in the future, so that the weaker side has an incentive to make a stand now.

Rationalist explanations of war can be critiqued on a number of grounds. The assumptions of cost-benefit calculations become dubious in the most extreme genocidal cases of World War II, where the only bargain offered in some cases was infinitely bad. Rationalist theories typically assume that the state acts as a unitary individual, doing what is best for the state as a whole; this is problematic when, for example, the country's leader is beholden to a very small number of people, as in a personalistic dictatorship. Rationalist theory also assumes that the actors are rational, able to accurately assess their likelihood of success or failure, but the proponents of the psychological theories above would disagree.

Rationalist theories are usually explicated with [[game theory]], for example, the [[Peace war game|Peace War Game]], not a [[Military simulation|wargame]] as such, rather a simulation of economic decisions underlying war.

===Political science theories===
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2008}}
The [[statistical]] analysis of war was pioneered by [[Lewis Fry Richardson]] following [[World War I]]. More recent databases of wars and armed conflict have been assembled by the Correlates of War Project, Peter Brecke and the [[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]].

There are several different [[international relations theory]] schools. Supporters of [[realism in international relations]] argue that the motivation of states is the quest for security.
Which sometimes is argued to contradict the realist view, that there is much empirical evidence to support the claim that states that are [[Democracy|democracies]] do not go to war with each other, an idea that has come to be known as the [[democratic peace theory]]. Other factors included are difference in moral and religious beliefs, economical and trade disagreements, declaring independence, and others.

Another major theory relating to [[power in international relations]] and ''[[Power politics|machtpolitik]]'' is the [[Power Transition theory]], which distributes the world into a hierarchy and explains major wars as part of a cycle of [[hegemony|hegemons]] being destabilized by a [[great power]] which does not support the hegemons' control.

Military adventurism can sometimes be used by political leaders as a means of boosting their domestic popularity, as has been recorded in US war-time presidential popularity surveys taken during the presidencies of several recent US leaders.&lt;ref name = &quot;MilitaryAdventurism&quot;&gt;{{cite web

==War ethics==
[[File:Morgen nach der Schlacht967b.jpg|thumb|200px|''Morning after the [[Battle of Waterloo]]'', by [[John Clark (artist)|John Heaviside Clarke]], 1816]]

{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2008}}
{{Original research|section|date=January 2010}}

The seeming contradiction between warfare and morality has led to serious [[morality|moral]] questions, which have been the subject of debate for thousands of years.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeForrest&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=DeForrest|first=Mark Edward|title=Conclusion|url=http://www.gonzagajil.org/content/view/72/26/|work=JUST WAR THEORY AND THE RECENT U.S. AIR STRIKES AGAINST IRAQ|publisher=Gonzaga Journal of International Law|accessdate=8/1/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate, generally speaking, has two main viewpoints: [[Pacifists]], who believe that war is inherently immoral and therefore is never justified regardless of circumstances, and those who believe that war is sometimes necessary and can be moral.

There are two different aspects to ethics in war, according to the most prominent and influential thought on justice and war: The [[Just War Theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=DeForrest|first=Mark Edward|title=GENERALLY RECOGNIZED PRINCIPLES OF JUST WAR THEORY|url=http://www.gonzagajil.org/content/view/72/26/|work=JUST WAR THEORY AND THE RECENT U.S. AIR STRIKES AGAINST IRAQ|publisher=Gonzaga Journal of International Law|accessdate=8/1/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Codevilla, Seabury 1989 304&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Codevilla, Seabury|first=Angelo, Paul|title=War: Ends and Means|year=1989|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-465-09067-2|page=304|url=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/157488610X/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_1?pf_rd_p=486539851&amp;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;pf_rd_i=0465090672&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_r=0144DHEVCX1XCVMJXAZQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; First is [[Jus ad bellum]] (literally translated as &quot;right to war&quot;), which dictates which unfriendly acts and circumstances justify a proper authority in declaring war on another nation. There are six main criteria for the declaration of a just war: first, any just war must be declared by a lawful authority; second, it must be a just and righteous cause, with sufficient gravity to merit large-scale violence; third, the just belligerent must have rightful intentions ? namely, that they seek to advance good and curtail evil; fourth, a just belligerent must have a reasonable chance of success; fifth, the war must be a last resort; and sixth, the ends being sought must be proportional to means being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aquinas|first=Thomas|title=Part II, Question 40|url=http://ethics.sandiego.edu/Books/Texts/Aquinas/JustWar.html|work=The Summa Theologica|publisher=Benziger Bros. edition, 1947|accessdate=8/1/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mosley|first=Alexander|title=The Jus Ad Bellum Convention|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/justwar/|work=Just War Theory|publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=8/1/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a just war has been declared, the second standard, or aspect, is put into effect. [[Jus in bello]], which literally translates to &quot;right in war&quot;, are the ethical rules of conduct when conducting war. The two main principles in ''jus in bello'' are proportionality and discrimination. Proportionality regards how much force is necessary and morally appropriate to the ends being sought and the injustice suffered.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moseley&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Moseley|first=Alexander|title=The Principles Of Jus In Bello|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/justwar/|work=Just War Theory|publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=8/1/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of Discrimination determines who are the legitimate targets in a war, and specifically makes a separation between combatants, who it is permissible to kill, and non-combatants, who it is not.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moseley&quot;/&gt; Failure to follow these rules can result in the loss of legitimacy for the just war belligerent, and so thereby forfeit the moral right and justice of their cause.&lt;ref name=&quot;Codevilla, Seabury 1989 304&quot;/&gt;
[[File:RIAN archive 324 In besieged Leningrad.jpg|thumb|210px|In besieged [[Leningrad]]. &quot;Hitler ordered that Moscow and Leningrad were to be razed to the ground; their inhabitants were to be annihilated or driven out by starvation. These intentions were part of the '[[General Plan East]]'.&quot; ?''The Oxford Companion to World War II.''&lt;ref&gt;Ian Dear, Michael Richard Daniell Foot (2001). ''The Oxford Companion to World War II.'' Oxford University Press. p.88. ISBN 0-19-860446-7&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Just War standard is as old as Western Civilization itself, and still has significant impact on thinking about the morality of wars and violence today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moseley|first=Alexander|title=Introduction|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/justwar/|work=Just War Theory|publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=8/1/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just War Theory was foundational in the creation of the [[United Nations]] and in [[International Law]]'s regulations on legitimate war.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeForrest&quot;/&gt;

These two positions generally cover the broad philosophical and ethical bents mainstream society. However, there are several theories on and about War which are in the minority in culture, but which, because of the influence they have had in recent history, demand mention here. These strains of thought on human society and war can be broken up into two main camps: [[Marxist]] and [[Fascist]], both of which view war as purely practical.

Marxism, and other such [[historicist]] ideals, hold that history advances through a set of [[dialectics]] (as stated by [[Heinrich Moritz Chalyb?us]]: thesis, antithesis, synthesis). Marx, and his followers, in particular held that history advances through violence. [[Marxism-Leninism]], in fact, held the belief that outright incitement to violence and war was necessary to topple [[Capitalism]] and free the [[proletariat]]. In these theories, the question of ethics has no place, as the value of the war is entirely dependent on whether it advances the revolution or synthesis.

Fascism, and the ideals it encompasses, such as [[Pragmatism]], [[Racism]], and [[Social Darwinism]], hold that violence is good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffin and Feldman, eds|first=Roger and Matthew|title=Fascism: Fascism and Culture|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=pg. 185}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woodley|first=Daniel|title=Fascism and political theory critical perspectives on fascist ideology|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-203-87157-X|page=276|url=http://wxy.seu.edu.cn/humanities/sociology/htmledit/uploadfile/system/20100724/20100724163537707.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Pragmatism holds that war and violence can be good if it serves the ends of the people, without regard for universal morality. Racism holds that violence is good so that a master race can be established, or to purge an inferior race from the earth, or both. Social Darwinism thinks that violence is sometimes necessary to weed the unfit from society so that civilization can flourish. These are broad [[archetypes]] for the general position that [[the ends justify the means]].
