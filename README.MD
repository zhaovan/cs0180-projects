The four projects in here were completed as part of a curriculum for the second semester of an intro computer science sequence. 
They were completed in java (shopnstop) and scala (search, sparkzilla, and guizilla)

A more detailed README of each project can be found in each folder

NOTE: Guizilla and Sparkzilla were completed as seperate projects but essentially built off of each other and used

Shopnstop: A portal for realtors and buyers to purchase listings in a database. Run through REPL

Search: A simplified version of Google's search engine (includes PageRank as a ranking algorithm)

Sparkzilla: A text-based browser that connects with a given server and displays the HTML. Run through REPL

Guizilla: A GUI-based browser that does the same. Also created a server that utilizes dynamic pages, cloning, and other server-based tasks
